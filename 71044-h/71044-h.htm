<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>IN WASHINGTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> four Corners were occupying the four
corners of the room. This may seem a rather
peculiar statement until you realize that the
first four Corners were called Nan, Mary Lee,
Jack and Jean. Nan, the eldest, was bent over
a table by the window in the west corner, Mary
Lee was standing before the mirror in the east
corner, Jack was sprawled out on the rug in the
north corner, and Jean was in the south corner
doing nothing in particular and looking abstractedly
into space.</p>

<p>The last mentioned was the first to make a
remark. “I think Washington is the most
beautiful city in the world,” she said moving
over to the window and gazing out at the avenue
of trees which were fast turning to sunny
yellow and brilliant green.</p>

<p>“Not lovelier than München, dear little München,”
responded Nan.</p>

<p>“Nor prettier than Paris,” put in Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I am not sure myself but Jean is
right,” Mary Lee asserted. “If it isn’t already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the loveliest city it soon will be. Of course it
isn’t quite as symmetrical as it might be, and
all the funny little frame houses stuck in between
stately mansions make it still look as if it wasn’t
finished, but time will mend that.”</p>

<p>“It is like a country girl who comes to town
wearing shabby gloves and shoes with a nice
tailor-made gown,” Nan suggested. “Of course,
after a while, when she has lived long enough,
she will be quite finished in her dress, but now
she still shows that she is young and a little
provincial.”</p>

<p>“What a way to put it, Nan,” said Mary
Lee.</p>

<p>“It is the way it impresses me,” returned her
sister. “Didn’t you notice how raggety and
taggety everything looked over here in our own
country after Europe? How the fences and
stretches of unkempt lots seemed so incomplete,
and the poorer houses seemed little and mean
instead of being picturesque, and how such
things had a tumble-down raw sort of look?
Of course I don’t say it will always be so, and
in a short hundred years we shall be quite a
sumptuous-appearing country, but as yet though
we may be important looking we are not very
picturesque. Think of those old, old palaces in
Venice. Think of those castles along the
Rhine, and all the ancient buildings that show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
history in every feature. Yes, I must say that
though we look prosperous we also look painfully
new.”</p>

<p>Mary Lee laughed. “You talk like a lecturer,”
she said. “Well, at any rate if we are
modern we are mighty comfortable, and that
suits me.”</p>

<p>“And we do have better things to eat here
than we get anywhere else,” put in Jean.</p>

<p>“Bound for you to discover that,” laughed
Nan.</p>

<p>“At all events,” Mary Lee went on, “I’m
glad to be back again, and I think we have
been mighty comfortable and have had a jolly
good time this past winter. I’m not kicking,
as Carter says.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, neither am I,” replied Nan.
“I was only comparing, that was all. I am an
American, stars and stripes, spread eagle, Hail
Columbia American, if you will have it, though
of course I do want to go back to Europe some
day, but I don’t want to live anywhere but in
this blessed old stuck-up country of ours, and
south of Mason and Dixon’s line at that. ‘I’ll
live and die for Dixie.’”</p>

<p>“I am glad Washington is south of Mason
and Dixon’s line,” remarked Mary Lee with
satisfaction. “It certainly was good of Maryland
to hand over a piece of herself to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the District of Columbia for the seat of government.”</p>

<p>“Maryland has been a pretty good state anyhow,”
Nan rejoined; “she stuck out, wouldn’t
give in on that matter of the Western territory
and she did a lot in all the wars. I am willing
to concede a great deal to her though I stand
up for Virginia first and foremost.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” returned Mary Lee emphatically.
“Well, I suppose we shall soon be
leaving Washington. Have you heard mother
or Aunt Helen say any more about the summer
plans? It is time we were hearing from Jo and
Danny. Wouldn’t it be nice if they could
spend a few days with us in Portland before we
branch off to wherever we are going?”</p>

<p>“It would be nice, for a fact. No, I haven’t
heard a word about any plans; the only conclusion
reached seems to be that we are to go
to Portland and from there bring up somewhere.
Mother thinks the seashore will not do
for her, so I suppose it will be the mountains,
or at least somewhere inland; they don’t seem
to know exactly.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt but Danny would join us.
Her uncle is so pleased with her progress that
he allows her almost anything she asks. I suppose
one reason is because she never asks unreasonable
things, and is so sweet about giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
up when he wants her to. Jo would give anything
to be with us, too, I know. Her last letter
was a perfect wail; she is so afraid we will
not stop in Boston, or will not get there before
her school closes. She hasn’t yet recovered
from our going to school in Washington instead
of returning to the Wadsworth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but dear me, it has been much better
here. We have been able to live at home in
this pleasant apartment, and mother has enjoyed
it so much; it would have been folly to
go back to the Wadsworth.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” said Jean coming into the
conversation. “I did hate those Saturday night
baked beans and never any of our own kinds
of hot bread.”</p>

<p>The others laughed. “You certainly are a
P. I. G., Jean,” said Nan, then, as Jean put on
an injured look, “I mean a perfectly irresistible
girl.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t mean that at all,” retorted Jean.</p>

<p>“I think they set a fairly good table at the
Wadsworth,” Mary Lee asserted, “still nothing
can ever come to one’s own home doings, of
course.”</p>

<p>“These home doings were Aunt Helen’s
doings,” Nan stated. “She wasn’t satisfied till
she had made hundreds of inquiries and had
seen dozens and dozens of apartments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“It is funny how things turn out,” Mary Lee
took up the thread again. “I suppose if we
hadn’t met Miss Cameron when we were going
to Spain we should never have come to Washington
at all this year.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that. I think Aunt
Helen had her heart set on it some time ago;
she has so many friends here, though we might
not have gone to Miss Cameron’s school.”</p>

<p>“The thing I want to know,” said Jack, suddenly
rousing herself from an absorbed attention
to things out-of-doors, “is what are we going
to do between now and the day we start for the
North?”</p>

<p>“There are lots of things to do,” Nan told
her.</p>

<p>“I think a good way would be to pick out
what each one wants most to see,” said Jack;
“the way we did in England, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well and good,” returned Nan. “Fire
ahead, Jack, you lean damsel.”</p>

<p>“I’m not as lean as you are,” retorted Jack,
“and I’d be as fat as Jean if I ate as much.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear,” said Nan in pretended surprise,
“I said Jacqueline, damsel.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t mean it that way at all; you
just said the other to make fun of me,” insisted
Jack.</p>

<p>“Prove it,” returned Nan good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Yes, you did,” Jean came to the rescue of
her twin, “just like you called me a P. I. G.
a while ago.”</p>

<p>“You’re such suspicious creatures,” responded
Nan. “Let’s change the subject. Go
on, Jack, what do you want most to see?”</p>

<p>“I want to go up the monument, or the dome
of the Capitol once more,” she decided.</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t that like you? Nothing short
of an aeroplane will ever satisfy you eventually,
Jack. When you get to heaven you will wear
out your wings before they are full fledged.
What is your choice, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Zoo, of course. There are some
new animals there I want to see. You know
I’m crite crazy to go there without crestioning.”</p>

<p>“I know you are crite craulified to be craurrelsome
to-day, and that I am in a craundary myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan,” protested Jean with irritation,
“you are so horrid when you mock us that
way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be good, I promise you,” replied Nan.
“What about you, Mary Lee? Do you want
to go to the Zoo, too?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but I must go once again to the
Smithsonian. I expected to know it by heart by
this time, but the chances to go have really been
very few.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Well, I am divided between the Government
greenhouses and the Corcoran Art Gallery,”
Nan told them. “Perhaps I shall have
time for both. I declare I shall really be sorry
to leave Washington; it is a pretty nice sort of
place when you come to think of all there is to
see and of all the pleasant things that are going
on all the time.”</p>

<p>“We ought to go to Arlington and Fort
Myer before we leave; it is lovely there this
time of year, they say.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Aunt Helen looking as if she
had some scheme afoot. Perhaps she has
decided about the summer plan.”</p>

<p>“How would you all like to drive to Fort
Myer to see the cavalry drill this afternoon?”
said Miss Helen coming in.</p>

<p>“We were just talking about that very thing,”
cried Mary Lee. “It would be fine, Aunt
Helen.”</p>

<p>“I think you would be interested and it is
a lovely afternoon. Your mother doesn’t care
to go out for she has been shopping all morning,
so if you will get ready we can start off in
about half an hour.”</p>

<p>It was already June and there was a feeling
of summer in the warm air. The season comes
early to the capital and the gardens were gay
with flowers; roses clambered over porches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
windows, fountains were playing, and grass was
green in the parks. Those who summered
away were fast leaving and the streets were
not so full of people as earlier. Old Georgetown
retained its usual quiet, broken at intervals
by a passing trolley-car or an automobile
climbing up the steep streets.</p>

<p>“There is one thing I like about Washington,”
remarked Nan as the carriage turned to
cross the Aqueduct bridge, “we need only to
pass over the Potomac and we are in Virginia,
and we can, moreover, see the shores of our
native state any time we choose. How lovely
the green banks look, Aunt Helen.”</p>

<p>“And the river, too,” said Jack. “I like
those places where the trees bend over to look
at themselves in the water.”</p>

<p>Nan smiled at her little sister. Jack was
wont once in a while to surprise her by some
such remark. She was a harum-scarum little
somebody, very sociable and impulsive though
warm-hearted and with a fearless spirit.</p>

<p>“And now we are in Virginia,” she went on
as the carriage left the bridge for the road.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel a bit different,” remarked her
twin.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you? I do,” declared Jack. “I
feel as if the blackberry bushes and sumachs
and the trees all belong to me.”</p>

<p>“<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>I hear a bugle call,” said Mary Lee. “We
must be near the post.”</p>

<p>They soon drew up amid a line of carriages
overlooking the parade ground where a body
of cavalry went through the manœuvres. Horses
dashed hither and thither, there was a clash of
sabres, a flash of steel as the riders wheeled
into position; then came the thud of horses’
hoofs as they responded to orders. At last,
after a furious gallop and a mad slashing at
pretended foes, the drill was over and the carriages
turned away.</p>

<p>“I liked it,” cried Jack. “Wasn’t it exciting
when they waved their sabres and went tearing
around the field? I imagined them swooping
down upon the Indians when they did that.”</p>

<p>“I saw one man thrown,” said Mary Lee,
“and his horse just trotted off to his place in
the stables quite as a matter of course. Wasn’t
that sensible?”</p>

<p>The driver by whose side she was sitting
smiled. “Dem beases has lots o’ sense, miss.
Dese yer ones o’ mine don’ lak nothin’ bettah
dan goin’ to one o’ dese yer drills. Dey knows
jes’ as well when we turns fo’ de bridge. Did
yuh see how dey kep’ a-lookin’ an’ a-lookin’
lak dey want ter be in de fiel’ deyselves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I didn’t; I was so interested myself. I
wish I had noticed them. They are nice horses,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
she added; “so sleek and well kept.” It was a
joy to her to discover a driver fond of his horses.</p>

<p>They drove on to Arlington, that fair estate,
and all were silent as they went through the
embowered avenues where lay the quiet soldiers
who were at peace after great conflict. The
elder girls and Miss Helen were more than
usually moved, for the old home of the Lees
had been that of their own kin, so they talked
but little and were glad to pass out of the gates
before the sunset gun gave notice of closing.
Across the river arose the domes and spires of
the capital city with the shaft of the monument
white against the sky.</p>

<p>“We’re going up that to-morrow,” announced
Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” declared Jean; “I’m going to the
Zoo with Mary Lee.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want to go Juning to the
Great Falls with me?” said their aunt.</p>

<p>“’Deed and ’deed we do,” cried Jack. “We
didn’t know that was on.”</p>

<p>“Is it to be a picnic, Aunt Helen? Won’t
that be fun?” said Jean.</p>

<p>“Would you rather go there, to Alexandria,
or to Mount Vernon?” asked Miss Helen.</p>

<p>“We’ve been to Mount Vernon,” said Nan;
“it would seem more picnicky to go to the
Falls, don’t you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Time was when it was very picnicky to go
to Mount Vernon,” said Miss Helen reminiscently.
“I can remember when I was a girl that
we used to take luncheon and eat it on the grass
there in front of the house. Visitors were few
then and the regulations were much less formal;
one almost felt as if she were visiting the family,
we were given such freedom. We could always
get milk from the dairy, could have a clipping
from the garden, and had access to many places
which now are shut away from the public.”</p>

<p>“Then I shouldn’t think you would care to
go there at all.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem much of a privilege in comparison
with the old free and easy times.”</p>

<p>“Then we will vote for the Falls. Don’t you
say so?” Nan appealed to her sisters, who all
agreed that it would be much more like going
a-Maying, or a-Juning as Miss Helen called it,
if they took a luncheon to the woods instead
of making a pilgrimage to Washington’s old
home.</p>

<p>As usual Jean was most particular in the
matter of what was to fill the lunch baskets and
superintended in person the making of sundry
special sandwiches, the buying of a large bottle
of stuffed olives, and the careful packing of
certain rich little cakes, so that her individual
basket showed no frugal meal. As Jack always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
depended upon receiving a share of her
twin’s provisions she did not trouble herself to
look out for more than crackers and cheese and
a little fruit while Nan with Mary Lee’s help
saw to it that there was enough for a substantial
luncheon in the basket which was to serve
themselves and Miss Helen.</p>

<p>Their way took them up the Virginia side of
the river to where the water of the Potomac
dashed madly over the rocks in furious eddys
and fierce whirlpools, being whipped into froth
as it was carried noisily on to the clearer and
quieter waters below.</p>

<p>“If it were in Europe or even in New England,”
remarked Nan when they had seated themselves
on the river’s bank and were contemplating
the rushing stream, “this spot would be
advertised and made one of the places to which
tourists would flock from all parts of the country,
but here it is not generally spoken of and
one may say is scarcely known.”</p>

<p>“I am glad it is so,” declared Jack. “I like
it just naturally wild and the way it has been
all these years. I don’t like the cleaned up
places, so neat and exact, all walled in and set
around by particular foot-paths with ‘Keep off
the grass’ signs everywhere, and ‘Admission
twenty-five cents’ at the entrance.”</p>

<p>“That’s where we agree, my dear,” Nan told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
her. “But, Jack, my honey, don’t try any dangerous
leaps or adventurous heights as you are
so fond of doing. Once you get caught in
those rapids there is an end to Jacqueline Corner;
we couldn’t possibly get you out.”</p>

<p>Jack peered seriously down into the seething
waters. Nan’s words were sufficiently terrifying
to keep her away from ticklish places, and
she made no random ventures.</p>

<p>“It would be nice to camp up here,” remarked
Mary Lee as she munched a jam sandwich.</p>

<p>“Not as nice as some other places,” returned
her aunt. “That gives me an idea, girls. I’ll
follow it up. Why didn’t I think of it before?
Capital! Just the thing! Why, of course it
is! How stupid of me.”</p>

<p>“You are so mysteriously disjointed, Aunt
Helen,” cried Nan. “What are you talking
about?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you exactly, myself, but you
shall know to-morrow. I’ll go to see Miss
Stewart this very evening.”</p>

<p>This only whetted the curiosity of the girls,
but their aunt changed the subject and refused
utterly to tell them what she had in mind.
Therefore they sat contentedly under the trees
while they finished eating their lunch, looking
across at the shining length of canal, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
tossing tumult of water between them and the
verdant heights of Maryland’s shores.</p>

<p>But Miss Helen was evidently so eager to
further her plans that she hurried them back
before the afternoon was over and while the
hucksters were still crying strawberries in the
drowsy streets of Georgetown and the bugle
calls at Fort Myer announced that the cavalry
drill was in progress.</p>

<small>IN PORTLAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> was in Aunt Helen’s mind was made
clear the next morning at breakfast when she
asked, “How should you all like camping out
in Maine?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Perfectly splendid. We’d love it
above all things. Great!” came from various
quarters. “So that is what you were talking
of yesterday, Aunt Helen. Do tell us all about
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I followed out my intention of going
to see Miss Stewart, who not long ago was telling
me of her very pleasant experience last
summer when she went to a camp in Maine.
Her report was so good that I continued the
matter by calling on Miss Marshall, who is one
of the two ladies having the camp in charge.
Everything appears so favorable that after talking
it over with your mother we have concluded
it will be the best thing for every one
concerned to spend some time at this special
camp, and I shall telephone Miss Marshall at
once that she may count upon our party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Exactly where is it?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“On a lake not far from the border lines of
Maine and New Hampshire, with the White
Mountains in sight, and a spur of them near
enough for any one to climb who feels so disposed.”</p>

<p>“Lovely! Go on. What are we to do
there?”</p>

<p>“You can have a canoe, two, if you choose,
and learn to paddle them.”</p>

<p>“Delicious thought,” cried Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“You will be able to take a walking tour up
the mountain, sleeping out in the open in order
to be on hand to see the sunrise.”</p>

<p>“Capital idea!” This from Nan. “What
else?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can roam the woods, read, play
games, drive, do anything that comes to
hand.”</p>

<p>“Shall we sleep in tents?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“You girls will, though I believe there are
two or three cabins; your mother and I will occupy
one.”</p>

<p>“Shall we have good things to eat?” asked
Jean a little anxiously.</p>

<p>“Miss Stewart says so. Miss Marshall takes
a real Southern cook from here, so we can count
on hot bread at least. Plenty of fresh milk
and butter are provided, vegetables from neighboring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
farms and fruit, too, so that it sounds
most alluring.”</p>

<p>“I should say it did,” returned Mary Lee.
“It is the very nicest thing possible. I am
crazy about it, and it will do us all so much
good to live out-of-doors, mother especially.
When do we start, Aunt Helen?”</p>

<p>“The camp opens the first of July, but I think
we shall start on somewhat earlier than that and
take a week in Portland. It will be a good centre
for some excursions and we shall enjoy a
short stay there, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“’Way up in Maine; think of it,” said Jack.
“I never expected to go there.”</p>

<p>“But we were nearly there when we went to
the Wadsworth school,” objected Jean.</p>

<p>“I don’t call Massachusetts nearly,” returned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Do we have to provide anything special?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe you are required to have certain
things.”</p>

<p>“And what are they?”</p>

<p>“Bloomers, short skirts, flannel shirts or
jumpers, blankets and pillows; if there is anything
else I have forgotten, but there is plenty
of time to find out.”</p>

<p>“What fun. May we go right away and get
the things we know we shall need?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“You may if you like. I think I can go with
you this morning. It behooves us not to be too
leisurely about it for June is upon us and your
mother wants to escape the hot weather of
Washington. It will be much pleasanter to
wait in Portland for July than here.”</p>

<p>So that very day there was a shopping expedition
to the Boston store, to Kann’s and to various
other places which should supply the needs a
camping out would mean. Then speedily as
might be, the start for the North was made;
Washington’s broad avenues were exchanged
for the clean, hilly streets of Portland, swept by
sea-breezes and quiet enough after the busy
cities of New York and Boston, to each of which
they had given a day. Neither place was unfamiliar,
therefore there was no sightseeing,
only a flying visit to see their dear friends Mr.
Pinckney and Miss Dolores in New York, and
from Boston a trip out to the Wadsworth school
to visit some of their schoolmates of two years
before. Charlotte Loring had entered college
and her face was missed, but Jo Keyes and
Daniella Scott were on hand overjoyed to see
the four Corners.</p>

<p>The idea of camp appealed to both, to Daniella
especially, for she had begun life in the woods
and its wildness still suggested the freedom and
unhampered days of her childhood. “I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
papa will let me go if I ask him,” she said when
they urged her to be one of the party.</p>

<p>Jo, however, when they put the question to
her, shook her head. “Too expensive a treat
for this child. Something like a pitch-your-tent-on-our-back-lot
would suit my purse better,
none of your modern elegancies such as summer
camps are. If you had suggested my
packing my tent and my clothes in a canoe,
lugging it across country on my back and dumping
it down by Lake Memphramagog or Molechunkemunk
Lake or some such Indian haunted
spot, I might consider it, but as it is, nay, nay,
Pauline; Josephine has not the price.”</p>

<p>But here, as often before, Miss Helen came to
the rescue, and after marching Jo up and down
the porch for a few minutes, during which there
was earnest conversation, the two returned to
the group sitting at the further end, and Miss
Helen announced, “It is settled. Jo is going
with us.”</p>

<p>“If my family consent,” put in Jo as a proviso.</p>

<p>“Of course they will consent,” said Nan.
“You know they will. My, but that is fine, Jo.
We consider you a great acquisition to our
party.”</p>

<p>“Thanky kindly, marm. I’m ready to dance
a jig for sheer joy. After all these months of
separation you Corners seem more desirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
than ever. Next year it’s a greasy grind for
Jo if she goes to college, for she will have to put
herself through by sewing on skirt braids or
doing some such menial work for the rest.”</p>

<p>The idea of Jo sewing on skirt braids or anything
else was so funny that they all laughed.
“Do try some other stunt than sewing, Jo,” Nan
proposed, “for I am sure your needle will never
put you through anything.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I can do till I try. I
am like the man who was asked if he could
play the violin, you know; he said he couldn’t
tell for he had never tried.”</p>

<p>“What about you, Danny?” asked Mary
Lee. “Of course you will write to Mr. Scott at
once.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shall. Let me see, the first of
July is not three weeks off, and school closes in
less than a week; there will be about ten days
in between.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we can easily put in that time
somewhere; I can go to Aunt Kit’s; she wants
me,” said Jo.</p>

<p>“And you will see Bruce,” exclaimed Jean.
“How is he getting along, Jo?”</p>

<p>“Finely. You never saw a cat more made
of. What shall you do with your in-between,
Danny?”</p>

<p>“Louise Burnett has been asking me for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
visit after school closes, and so has Effie
Glenn.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” ejaculated Nan, “how this all
does remind me of the old days. Has Blue
China another parrot, Jo?”</p>

<p>“No, thank goodness, and this year she has
been away a good deal so we have been spared
her prim presence.”</p>

<p>“Reminiscing does so fly away with time,”
remarked Mary Lee as she looked at her watch.
“We must go if we are to get back to mother
in time for dinner. Well, girls, it isn’t good-bye,
it is only <i>auf wiedersehn</i>.”</p>

<p>“Or <i>hasta luego</i>,” put in Mary Lee who preferred
Spanish for reasons of her own.</p>

<p>“You are such a darling, Aunt Helen,” whispered
Nan when they were seated in the train.
“It was just dear of you to do that for Jo.”</p>

<p>“I like Jo,” returned Miss Helen, “and I
think she ought to be given every chance. She
has improved wonderfully.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must say that she has. She used to
be the slangiest creature I ever saw; she is not
near so boisterous either.”</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that it would be just as
well if she didn’t go home this summer. I
don’t think her stepmother is the slightest
advantage to her.”</p>

<p>“Far from it. Well, if she does get through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
college she will then be able to make her own
way and live her own life. Isn’t Danny a
beauty? but she always was. Talk about improvement,
there you have it. You never hear
her say nowadays such things as: ‘she gave it
to you and I,’ or ‘those sort of girls.’ Dear
me, we had a struggle with her to get those two
things all right. Now she seems like any other
nice girl and she visits the Burnetts and the
Glenns constantly. The Glenns are so very
fond of her, and the Burnetts want her to spend
the summer with them at their seashore
cottage.”</p>

<p>“She will enjoy the camp far more.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it; one could see how eager
she was.”</p>

<p>Portland reached there were three weeks still
before them, but these were by no means slow in
passing. A trip to the beautiful Songo River,
to the various islands in charming Casco Bay,
to the old town of Brunswick to see Bowdoin
College and the old Longfellow house; there was
no lack of places to go and at the end of two
weeks they had not exhausted all their resources,
then suddenly upon the scene appeared an entirely
unlooked-for figure. The meeting came
about in this way: Miss Helen was making some
purchases in one of Portland’s pleasant shops
when a gaunt, weather-beaten woman happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to be standing by her side. She was peculiarly
dressed, wearing men’s boots and a man’s coat
rather the worse for wear; on her head was a
nondescript hat and her bony, gloveless hands
gave evidence of rough work. As Miss Helen
gave her name and address the woman looked
at her sharply, then followed her to the next
counter before which she stopped.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” began the stranger, “but I
heard you give the name of Corner. We don’t
have that name up here, but my mother had
relatives of that name; she hasn’t heard from
’em for years, but she would be that pleased if
you happened to know any of the family in
Virginia. You speak like a Virginian and
that’s why I made bold to mention it.”</p>

<p>“I am from Virginia, and my name is Corner,”
returned Miss Helen. “What is your
mother’s name?”</p>

<p>“She’s a Hooper now. My father was Everett
Hooper, but her maiden name was Daingerfield
and she was from Albemarle County, Virginia.
Maria Carter Daingerfield was her name before
she was married.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course; she was my mother’s first
cousin, I suspect. I’ve often and often heard
my mother tell the story of how Maria Daingerfield
was carried off prisoner by a Yankee
officer; that is the way she used to put it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Yes, and that’s the way my mother still
puts it. Well, well, well, won’t she be pleased
when I tell her?”</p>

<p>“She is still living?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but pretty feeble, keeps her room
winters altogether. I do wish, Miss Corner,
that you could find an opportunity to come to
see her. We live up Sebago way; it’s easy
getting there. You could take the train to
Sebago and I’d meet you, and if you could
just set the day. Are you alone here?”</p>

<p>“No, cousin—— Is your name Maria,
too?”</p>

<p>“I’m Phebe, Cousin Phebe, if you like. No’m,
I’m unmarried; I’m still Phebe Hooper.”</p>

<p>“And I am still Helen Corner. My brother’s
widow and her four girls are here with me in
Portland.”</p>

<p>“Fetch ’em along if they’d like to come.
Come all of you and spend the day. My, my,
it’ll be like a breath of summer from the pines
to mother. Dear suz, I’m that excited I dunno
as I shan’t miss my train. When did you say
you’d come?”</p>

<p>Miss Helen thought rapidly. “Where did
you say it was?”</p>

<p>“About two miles from Sebago.”</p>

<p>“And that’s on the way to Fryeburg, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then we might stop off on our way to
camp.”</p>

<p>“Be you going to camp? Well, I declare.
I cal’late you’d be just as well off under a roof,
but every one to his taste. When you going?”</p>

<p>“In about a week or ten days.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you come make us a visit and
stay that time? Where you putting up?”</p>

<p>“At the La Fayette.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, we can’t give you hotel accommodations,
but if you can be content in our
two spare rooms we’ll make you as comfortable
as we can in a farmhouse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Cousin Phebe, you are too
kind; we couldn’t think of bearing down upon
you with such a legion, but we shall be delighted
to spend the day.”</p>

<p>Miss Phebe looked a little relieved. She did
not wish to seem wanting in that Southern hospitality
whose traditions her mother had struggled
to keep alive, but to take in six strangers
with their baggage would have been an undertaking
rather beyond her powers. “Then
just name the day,” she said, “and I’ll meet
you. There is a good morning train and it
isn’t much of a trip. The sooner the better,
for mother’s feeling right smart now. She
has a spell once in a while but she had one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
last week and I cal’late she won’t have another
for a while.”</p>

<p>“Then shall we say day after to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“That’ll suit first-rate. Give me time to get
mother prepared. I’ll be at the station sure.
Good-bye. I’m so pleased to have met you.
I’ll look for you Thursday if it don’t rain.”
She picked up the net bag she carried and hurried
off, Miss Helen looking after with an
amused smile.</p>

<p>“Mary,” she said to her sister-in-law when
she returned to the hotel, “did we ever suppose
we should pick up a relative here away down
east?”</p>

<p>“Why, Helen, who is it? I’m sure I know
of no one.”</p>

<p>“Who is it, Aunt Helen?” asked Nan looking
up from some post cards she had bought
that day.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, her name is Phebe Hooper.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of her.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” declared Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Surely you have heard of
Maria Daingerfield.”</p>

<p>“Now I begin to see light. She is the one
of whom the elder members of the family
speak with bated breath because she married a
Yankee officer. Her father practically disowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
her, didn’t he? Cut her off with a shilling,
so to speak?”</p>

<p>“Yes, poor man, if he had so much as a
shilling when the war was over. He was very
bitter, I believe, and I have heard mother say
that Cousin Maria had practically no intercourse
with her family after she went North to live.
Well, my dear, I have this morning met her
daughter Phebe Hooper, a rough and ready
sort of person, but I imagine she is as good
as gold. At any rate she is good to her mother
and wanted the whole party of us to come make
them a visit. Of course I knew it was out of the
question to think of quartering six absolute
strangers upon them, but I liked her for asking;
it showed that there was a lot of her
mother in her, though she talks like a Yankee,
not of the best class, either, and doesn’t look
like any of our family that I ever saw. Well,
we compromised by my promising to take you
all to spend the day with them on Thursday.
They live in the country near Sebago and I think
that it will not only be a pleasure to us but one
to Cousin Maria, as well. She is quite an invalid
from rheumatism. It will be a great thing
for her to hear of her old home and those relatives
we know something about.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it be a lark?” said Nan. “Poor old
dear! Imagine living all your life away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Virginia when you were born there.” She
spoke with such fervency that Miss Helen
laughed.</p>

<p>“You are the most loyal girl, Nan. You
lead us to suppose that there is but one state
worth while and that it is our own.”</p>

<p>“Nan is a true Virginian,” said Mrs. Corner.
“She probably will admit that there are advantages
elsewhere, but that preëminent above
all other spots is her native state. She feels a
little sorry, I think, for those who were not born
in the Old Dominion.”</p>

<p>“I believe I do,” Nan acknowledged thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Rather conservative and provincial, Nan,”
warned Miss Helen. “You’ll have to learn to
be more cosmopolitan than that, else we shall
have to keep you traveling till you do see that
each country, each state or city has its own attractions
and can make some claim over the
rest. All are not entirely good.”</p>

<p>“Munich came pretty near it,” said Nan with
a thought to the charming German city where
they had spent six months.</p>

<p>“You are making progress if you can admit
that much and yield it claims over Virginia.”</p>

<p>“It has different attractions, of course,
but——”</p>

<p>“Exactly. That is what I have been saying.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
No place on earth has everything, but to return
to Cousin Maria. Shall you all be ready to
take an early train? And, Mary, do rack your
brain for reminiscences for the entertainment of
Cousin Maria. I am sure she will want to
know all about every Tom, Dick and Harry
who was ever related to her in the remotest degree.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be ready, won’t we?” Nan turned to
Mary Lee who promised that she would for
one, then scenting a romance she said:</p>

<p>“How did it happen that she married a Yankee
officer?”</p>

<p>“Quite in the approved way of romances.
During a battle which took place in the neighborhood,
Captain Hooper was wounded and
was brought into the house. Cousin Maria’s
father was in the Confederate army, so were
her two brothers; both brothers were killed, by
the way, and that was one reason for her father’s
great bitterness of spirit. Cousin Maria,
her mother and her old mammy nursed Captain
Hooper and in due course of time the
young people fell in love with one another,
which was a perfectly natural sequel. Well,
he went away, Maria’s secretly accepted lover.
Later on the invading army burned the house
to the ground, which naturally added to old
Colonel Daingerfield’s bitterness, as it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
home of his forefathers. Maria, her mother and
the old mammy took refuge with a neighbor.
The colonel’s rage, distress and despair made
him so violent that he could say nothing but
evil of those who fought on the other side, and
once when he learned that Maria had received
a letter from an officer in the Federal army his
fury knew no bounds. So, poor Maria felt that
it would be useless ever to expect his consent
to her marriage with her lover, though she
managed to get letters through the lines to him
once in a while. After a while when everything
they possessed was swept away, and her
mother died, she was in despair. Her father
was either gloomy, severe and forbidding or in
a paroxysm of rage when the future was mentioned,
so she decided that she would go to her
lover whenever he could plan for their marriage,
then a little later on, when his company
was encamped near the town where she was
staying, he dashed in one night with a couple
of horses, and, as she always maintained, literally
carried her off prisoner. They were married
at once by the chaplain of the regiment
and she went to Washington to some friends
there to remain till the war was over. She
never saw any of her people again.”</p>

<p>“I think that is a most thrilling tale,” said
Mary Lee. “I am fairly tingling with excitement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and I am so glad we are going to see the
heroine of such a story. Do you believe she
will tell us more about it? I should like to
hear all the details.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she will, though it may be that she
will not care to talk of it.”</p>

<p>“Did her father never forgive her?” asked
Jack, who had been listening.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that. I hope so, though he
can scarcely be blamed if he didn’t. She was
his only remaining child, and he felt that she
had deserted him, her home and the cause, not
to mention her relatives.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t desert my family for any man,”
said Jack positively.</p>

<p>“I expect she was awfully homesick,” remarked
Jean.</p>

<p>“I’d like to take her something, Aunt Helen,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“What should you like to take her,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Something from Virginia, if I had it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner and Miss Helen exchanged
glances. Jack was the most warm-hearted child
in the world and the thought was quite in character.
“I brought away some snap-shots of the
old home and some of the scenery around,”
said Mrs. Corner. “They are some Dr. Woods
sent me, but I can get duplicates, I know. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
should you like to get a small album to put
them in and give that to Cousin Maria?”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” exclaimed Jack. “That
is a darling idea, mother.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show them to you if you will get them
from my room,” said Mrs. Corner. “They are
on the shelf where the clock is, and are in a
blue envelope. We can select whatever seems
suitable.”</p>

<p>Jack ran off highly pleased, but leaving all
the others busily thinking what they could carry
as gifts to their down-east cousin.</p>

<small>COUSIN MARIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> romance surrounding Cousin Maria’s
early days gave zest to the expedition upon
which the Corners started on the day appointed.
Each was provided with some gift; Jack, of
course, carried her book of photographs, Mary
Lee took a little Indian basket, Jean had a box
of peppermints. “Old ladies always like peppermints,”
she said. Nan had wavered between
a volume of Father Ryan’s poems and one of
Thomas Nelson Page’s collections of stories, but
finally decided upon the latter as perhaps Cousin
Maria did not care for poetry.</p>

<p>It was not a long trip, and when they alighted
at the station it was still rather early in the day.
Miss Phebe was there to meet them, “booted
and spurred,” as Nan said afterward. If the
children had not been prepared, and if they had
not been too polite to stare, they certainly would
have gazed in amazement at the odd figure
which presented itself to their view as they stood
waiting on the platform. Miss Helen made the
proper introductions which Miss Phebe acknowledged
in the set phrase, “Pleased to meet you,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and with a funny little bob of the head. She
led the way to a weather-beaten old buggy,
mud-splashed and dingy. “I cal’lated one of
you could ride in here with me,” she said, “and
the rest could go with Nathan in the wagon.
He’s put a lot of clean straw in, and I guess
you’ll go comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a straw ride? What fun!” cried Jack,
to whom most novelties were agreeable. “Aunt
Helen, you can sit with the driver if you want
to.” As Jack always claimed this privilege for
herself, Miss Helen was fain to believe that
either she was disposed to sacrifice herself to
her aunt’s comfort, or that riding on the straw-strewn
floor of the wagon held superior charms,
so she smilingly acquiesced. They all clambered
in after Mrs. Corner had taken her place in the
buggy, and the start was made in a merry
mood.</p>

<p>Nathaniel, or Nat, as he preferred to be called,
was a shrewd-looking, lank young man, younger
than his length of limb and huge fists would indicate.
He spoke in a high key with a slow,
soft drawl and was not backward in asking
questions, though he vouchsafed replies to those
Miss Helen put to him, and by reason of which
she learned that he was Miss Phebe’s sole assistant
except when the apples were to be gathered
or some other crop should be brought in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Me and her runs the place,” said Nat.
“She works as good as a man when it comes
to some things. No, marm, she ain’t no hired
girl. I fetch in the milk; she tends to it. I
look after the stawk, caow, and three hawses;
she tends to the fowls. We got a sight of apples
last fall, great crawp. I tended to gittin’
of ’em in, she tended to shippin’ of ’em. Taters
same way. Yes, marm, we got a pretty good
garden, not so smart-looking as old Adam Souleses
maybe, but I ain’t ashamed of it. First
corn I put in, didn’t the crows get every namable
bit? Wal, I rigged up a scarecrow and got
out my shotgun, so I guess the second crawp’ll
stay where it was put. Your folks raise a sight
of corn down your way, don’t ye? Use it, too,
I hear. I ain’t a mite stuck on corn bread
myself. She makes good sody biscuits, though
the old lady does complain she makes ’em too
precious big. I like ’em that way. Don’t have
to say ‘Pass them biscuits,’ so often, or if they’re
on the other side of the table you don’t have to
rise every few minutes to fork one over. It’s a
right sightly place, ain’t it?” He pointed with
his whip to a low white house whose barn was
in such close proximity as to be literally under
the same roof. An extensive apple orchard,
whose blossoming was just over, stretched for
some distance on one side. Two poplars stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
in front of the house and a weeping willow upon
the modest lawn around which the roadway extended.
“That’s our tater patch.” Nat indicated
a field which they were passing. “We
grow ’em big up here.”</p>

<p>“They’re not the only things you grow big,”
Miss Helen could not forbear saying with a
glance at the display of ankle below the blue
jeans.</p>

<p>Nat burst into a loud guffaw. “That’s right
I swan it don’t seem as if I’d ever stop growing,
and these here pants hitches up higher every
time they come out of wahsh. Look at them
sleeves, too.” He stretched out a mighty
arm which showed several inches of red wrist
below the band. “I won’t come of age for three
years nearly, and look at me, bigger’n git out.
My grandfather was just that way, growed and
growed till they had to pile bricks on his head
to keep him down so he could stand up in the
settin’-room.” He gave a wink over his shoulder
at Jack, who was taking this all in.</p>

<p>“What became of your grandfather?” asked
Jack, standing up and hanging on the seat
where her aunt sat. “Did he keep on growing?”</p>

<p>“No, he stopped short of six foot six, and
when he died there wa’n’t no coffin big enough
for him. Had to send to Portland and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
one made special. They didn’t surmise he’d
need it so soon or they might have had it ready
beforehand so’s not to put the funeral off like
they had to.”</p>

<p>“Did he die suddenly?” asked Jack, interested
in this lugubrious subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, marm. Died awful suddent. Got up
as well as you or me, eat his breakfast, tended
to his hawse, white hawse he had, come in the
house, fetched a few hacks and went.”</p>

<p>Jack sidled over toward her aunt and whispered,
“What does he mean by hacks? Did
he keep a livery stable?”</p>

<p>Miss Helen could scarcely keep her face sufficiently
grave to whisper back: “No, dear, he
means he coughed once or twice.”</p>

<p>“Wal, here we are and here we be,” announced
Nat, drawing up his horses before the
gate. “I see Miss Phebe’s got ahead of us, but
what can ye expect with a load of six and her
with only them two. Jest wait, marm, and I’ll
lift ye down.” He performed this office, if
rather ungracefully, certainly skilfully, for he
swung the little figure of Miss Helen to the
ground as if she were a bag of potatoes. The
others clambered out at the tail of the wagon
and went forward to where Mrs. Corner and
Miss Phebe stood on the little porch before the
door. On either side lilacs were in bloom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and a climbing rose was trained over the window.</p>

<p>The entry, covered with oilcloth, separated
parlor from sitting-room. The former, opened
only on state occasion, had a queer, musty
smell, as of a place seldom aired. Haircloth
covered furniture stood at stiff angles. A
marble-topped table bore a lamp, a photograph
album, one or two books and ornaments. There
were two crayon portraits on the wall, one of
Captain Hooper in uniform, another of a young
woman with two children by her side. The
four girls disposed themselves upon the long
sofa which stood primly against the wall.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it stuffy?” said Jack in a low tone to
Nan.</p>

<p>Nan nodded.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they open the windows this
lovely day, so the smell of the lilacs can come
in?” continued Jack.</p>

<p>Nan shook her head at the questioner, for
Miss Phebe appeared upon the threshold.
“Mother’ll be pleased to see you,” she said, addressing
Miss Helen. “I think, if you’ll excuse
me,” she turned to the girls, “that she’d better
not see you all at once; it might be too exciting
for her; she’s not used to much company.
Do you mind waiting till she’s got accustomed
to your mother and aunt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The girls assured her that they did not mind
in the least.</p>

<p>“If you’ll entertain yourselves with any of
the books or things, we won’t be long,” continued
Miss Phebe apologetically. “There’s a
box of shells on the lower shelf of the whatnot;
you might like to look at them. My
Grandfather Hooper was a seafaring man, and
he brought them home from foreign parts.
Some of them are real pretty.” She stooped
down, lifted the box and set it on the broad
window-sill, then she conducted Miss Helen
and Mrs. Corner to the room across the
entry.</p>

<p>While the twins took possession of the box
of shells Nan and Mary Lee made a survey of
the books on the table.</p>

<p>“They’re awfully stupid,” declared Mary Lee,
reading the titles: “‘History of Cumberland
County,’ ‘The Life of General Grant,’ ‘Aids to
the Young.’ What a funny old book. Thomson’s
‘Seasons,’ Young’s ‘Night Thoughts.’
Do look here, Nan, at the illustrations; aren’t
they weird? Oh, dear, I’d hate to be shut up
long in this house. Do you suppose we dare
to open a window or go out-of-doors?”</p>

<p>Nan laid down a copy of Shakespeare she
had found. “I don’t know,” she replied. “Perhaps
we’d better not take any liberties. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
suppose it will be long before we shall be summoned.”</p>

<p>“Do look at this carpet,” continued Mary
Lee; “isn’t it hideous? And whoever heard
of keeping a carpet down all the year round?
And those portraits are ghastly. Is the lady
Cousin Maria, do you reckon, and is the little
girl Cousin Phebe? I seem to distinguish a
faint likeness.”</p>

<p>“I should think it might be she. Let’s look
through the photographs, then maybe we can
trace her all along succeeding years.”</p>

<p>They took the red morocco album over to one
of the windows and began to turn its pages,
once or twice happening upon some photograph
familiar to them. “That’s Cousin Martin Boyd,”
cried Nan. “He is in Aunt Helen’s album at
home, the old one that was her mother’s. And
oh, Mary Lee, the lady in hoops and a funny
bonnet is Grandma Corner herself. It isn’t a
bit like the lovely portrait that used to be at
Uplands, but I recognize her. And there is
father when he was a youngster. Don’t you
remember it? I fancy that very fierce-looking
individual in Confederate uniform is Cousin
Maria’s father. The others must all be Hoopers
by the cut of the jib.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’re a very interesting
lot,” remarked Mary Lee, viewing the series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
stiffly posed persons, bearded men in long-tailed
coats, women in hooped petticoats and beruffled
gowns worn long on the shoulder, and
with hair arranged in waterfall curls. “They
take much better photographs now,” she commented.</p>

<p>“Of course. Probably the art was in its
infancy when these were taken.”</p>

<p>“Certainly these people weren’t,” returned
Mary Lee. “They look as ancient as the hills,
even the children.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Cousin Phebe with an order
for our release,” said Nan. So they put the
album back on the table and stood waiting.</p>

<p>“Mother’s ready now,” announced Miss
Phebe. “She was quite overcome and I had
to give her some drops, but now that she’s over
the excitement of the meeting she is quite
happy and wants to see Grace Corner’s grandchildren,
she says.”</p>

<p>The girls filed in procession across the hall
to the door of the sitting-room which Miss
Phebe opened disclosing a bright, cheerful room
with plants in the windows, a red table-cloth on
the table, a bright carpet, a sideboard set off
with silver and glass. By an open fire sat a
little white-haired old lady in black gown and
white cap who looked up expectantly as the
children entered. “Come right along, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
dears,” she said in a pleasant voice. “This is
a great day for me. You’ll excuse my rising,
I’m so stiff with rheumatism.”</p>

<p>The girls came forward and stood a-row,
Mrs. Hooper scanning each one in turn as they
were presented by name. “Nancy looks like
the Corners,” she decided, “Mary Lee like her
mother’s family; the others are composite; they
are twins, you said, Phebe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“Little Jack Corner’s children. He was such
a boy when he went into the army. I remember
well the day he came over to tell us he
was going. Dear me, dear me, so long ago,
so long and here I am a New Englander.
Dear me, dear me.” She shook her head as
she looked from one to the other. All the old
memories were stirred by this sudden appearance
of her kin.</p>

<p>Then the presentation of gifts took place, a
process which while it greatly pleased Cousin
Maria reduced her to tears. “To think of it,
Phebe,” she whimpered, “my own flesh and
blood kin and they’ve brought me gifts as if
they had known me all their lives. Oh, there
are none like them, none like my own people
down South.”</p>

<p>“Now, mother,” said Miss Phebe in a tone
which sounded severe, but which really arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
from hurt feelings, “I hope you remember that
father and I weren’t from down South.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a good child, Phebe; I know
that, and Everett was a good, kind husband,
but you are both alien, alien.”</p>

<p>This was pretty hard on Miss Phebe considering
she had always been the most dutiful and
conscientious of daughters and sacrificed herself
daily for her mother, but as Miss Helen
said afterward, “the Daingerfields always were
sentimental,” so Cousin Maria was allowed to
have her little weep and then recovered herself
enough to become quite animated over the
gifts, all of which pleased her mightily, though
the photographs seemed to possess the greatest
value in her eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Phebe slipped out, the duties of hostess
and cook so clashing that she was put to it in
trying to fill both offices suitably. “Phebe’s a
good child; a better daughter than I deserve,”
sighed Cousin Maria. “She is a Hooper to
the back-bone, I can tell you that; just like
her father’s people.” She turned suddenly
and laid her hand on Miss Helen’s arm. “Oh,
I tell you, it wasn’t easy at first. Oh, my dears,
you will never know what it is to be as homesick
as I was. I had a good, kind husband
and I loved him, but their ways were so different.
I never had been used to lifting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
finger; always a houseful of darkies at my beck
and call; always neighbors to drive over and
gossip. Oh, my dears, when I saw my mother-in-law
and her daughters doing their own
work, rarely visiting, keeping the parlor shut
up year in, year out, no dances, no fun of any
kind, I was appalled. Of course I was looked
upon with coolness and dislike because I was
a Southerner, but that did not make as much
difference as the other things, and when I
learned what was expected of me——” She
shook her head and sighed deeply. “It was uphill
work, that learning their ways. Once or
twice I was so unhappy I was ready to fly from
it all, but there was Everett, so kind and considerate,
though he could only half guess what
I missed, and then came my baby, my little
son.” She paused and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Helen gently patted her hand. “Never
mind, Cousin Maria,” she said, “that is all over
now, and even if you had gone back, or if you
had never come away it wouldn’t have been
the same. There were hard times in Virginia
and all throughout the South; the women down
there had to work as hard as here, after the war.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know, I know. When my little
boy died I realized something of what my
parents suffered, and I felt it was a judgment
on me for leaving my father, so I could never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
rebel against the punishment, for I could see it
was just. Poor father! He did forgive me at
last, you know. When my baby died I wrote
to him, but he did not answer till a year later,
but he forgave me.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” breathed Jack pressing
nearer. “You know we think you had such a
beautiful romantic love story, Cousin Maria, and
we were so glad we could come to see you,”
though in her heart of hearts she was rather
disappointed that the heroine of the tale should
prove to be this plain little old woman. “I
wish you would tell us all about it; how you
ran away with Captain Hooper and all that;
we are so interested.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hooper smiled reminiscently, then she
turned to Mrs. Corner. “You would know her
for a Southern girl, so spontaneous and outspoken.
Well, dear, I will tell you how it was.”</p>

<p>Though Nan would like to have listened to
this story she had an uneasy feeling that Miss
Phebe might need help, so she quietly left the
room. Nan was always the one who carried
the heaviest packages, who ran back for umbrellas,
or lugged a double amount of hand-luggage,
so it was like her to do this. She
conjectured that the kitchen would be at the
back and she set to work to find it, first opening
the door of a closet, then one which led out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
upon a back porch, but the third one seemed to
be right, as she found a little entry from beyond
which came sounds and odors which told of
the kitchen’s whereabouts. As she paused
upon the door-sill Miss Phebe, busily stirring
around, cried out, “Land sakes!” as she saw
the figure in the doorway.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps I could help you, Cousin
Phebe,” said Nan.</p>

<p>Miss Phebe looked quite taken aback and
said nervously, “No, thank you; I couldn’t
think of letting you do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“But why not?” Nan could not understand
the New England spirit which scorned assistance
and resented intrusion.</p>

<p>“Please,” she continued. “I always help
Cousin Mag when I go over there. Couldn’t I
set the table?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I set that before I went to the
train.”</p>

<p>Still Nan persisted. She stepped into the
kitchen. “Well, I could pare potatoes or something.”</p>

<p>Miss Phebe shook her head. “Nat did those
after breakfast. There is really nothing to do.
I made the pies and doughnuts this morning,
the custards yesterday. There isn’t a thing to
do but stir up some sody biscuits. I’ve got the
peas and potatoes on. Does your ma like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
tea or coffee? and your aunt, what does she
drink?”</p>

<p>Nan was doubtful. She knew her Aunt Helen
depended upon her afternoon tea, and missing
it to-day might like it earlier. “Suppose I go
and ask,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I can make both,” returned Miss
Phebe hurriedly.</p>

<p>“But why, if it isn’t necessary?”</p>

<p>Miss Phebe murmured something about its
not being polite. Her Puritan conscience would
not permit her to be slack in even so small a
matter, nor must her guests discover her wanting
in hospitality, so as Nan saw she would be
really distressed if the question were carried
further, she gave up all idea of making inquiry,
but begged Cousin Phebe to allow her to skim
the milk and cut the butter which finally she
was permitted to do.</p>

<p>“You must have been up very early to get
so much done before you went to the train,”
remarked the girl.</p>

<p>“Not much earlier than usual,” was the reply.
“I wasn’t up before four.”</p>

<p>Nan stared. Four o’clock! and she had been
on the go ever since. “I should think you
would be worn to a bone,” she said looking at
the wiry spare figure.</p>

<p>Miss Phebe smiled grimly and said, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
little bridling of the head, “We don’t believe
in wasting daylight up here.” Surely the
ante-bellum days had departed for Cousin
Maria Hooper who, in the other room, was telling
of the good old times before the war, when
she “never raised her hand to do a thing and
was carried around on a silver waiter, my
dear.”</p>

<p>“If you want to get along you’ve got to
work,” said Miss Phebe reading something of
Nan’s thought.</p>

<p>“Or else be smart enough to make others
work for you,” returned Nan laughing. “Isn’t
it a sign of ability to plan what a duller brain
executes?”</p>

<p>“I was never taught to expect any one to do
my work, and I never had time to stop to ask
such questions,” returned Miss Phebe with a
little asperity. “My father died when I was
eighteen and I have been at it ever since, trying
to keep up the place and make a little out of it.”</p>

<p>“Shall I carry these in?” asked Nan, seeing
it was out of place to argue, and standing with
bread-plate in one hand and butter in the
other.</p>

<p>“If you will be so kind.”</p>

<p>Nan went into the dining-room and set the
things on the table, then she helped Miss Phebe
dish up, carrying in peas and potatoes, pickles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and jelly, doughnuts and “sody” biscuits, custards
and pies and lastly—wonder of wonders—fried
chicken. This was Miss Phebe’s chef-d’œuvre,
a dish suggested by her mother and one
which the daughter had been taught to prepare
years before. Yielding in this one particular she
offered a Northern bill of fare in other respects,
to Jean’s great satisfaction, who was delighted
to see the array of sweet things, doughnuts and
pies, preserves and cake, custards and cookies.</p>

<p>“Even Emerson ate pie for breakfast,” remarked
Miss Helen as they settled themselves
in the train late that afternoon. The day had
been an unforgettable one in many respects, in
which the quaint, queer figure of Cousin Phebe
stood out alone.</p>

<p>“With so many excellent qualities, so many
virtues, and yet so unattractive,” said Mrs.
Corner.</p>

<p>“No doubt if you could penetrate the
crust you would find a warm heart,” returned
Miss Helen. “Cousin Maria is pathetic, and
how she clung to us! I am glad we promised
to see them again before we leave these parts.
Poor Cousin Maria! Environment has forced
her into a growth different from that which
nature and birth intended, and she is worn out
in the struggle. She told me nothing in life
could have given her such pleasure as our visit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
One feels very humble before such a state of
things.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Nan, “there is nothing
Cousin Phebe would not do for her mother, and
I believe she enjoyed our coming, too, though
one would never guess it except that she was
so eager that we should come again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she works a bit harder than
Cousin Sarah,” commented Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, my child, Cousin Sarah never in her
life got up at four o’clock in the morning to
make pies and doughnuts before breakfast,”
said Nan.</p>

<p>“Nat says if we will come in the fall he will
show us more apples than we ever saw in our
lives,” remarked Jean.</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated Mary Lee; “he never
saw the Albemarle pippins on Cousin Phil’s
farm up on the mountain.”</p>

<small>THE START FOR CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few days came Daniella Scott and Jo
Keyes, ready to join forces with the Corners.
Jo was in high spirits. This was her last year
at the Wadsworth school and she felt free as a
bird, she declared. Daniella, whose school-days
had not begun till she was quite a big girl,
was still looking forward to several years of
boarding-school life. The prospect of a summer
in the woods was perhaps dearer to her
than to any of the others.</p>

<p>There was first to be a short railway journey,
then a long ride by stage and finally a drive
of two or three miles which would bring them
to the borders of a lovely lake set in the green-wood,
and here they would find the camp.</p>

<p>As they left the train, at a small town, a big
old-fashioned stage, swung on leathers, lumbered
up. It was drawn by four horses and its
driver, a wiry old man, with a tuft of white
beard under his chin, called out, “Be you
a-going to Friendship?”</p>

<p>“We are,” replied Miss Helen.</p>

<p>“How many air ye?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Eight.”</p>

<p>“Got many traps?”</p>

<p>“A small trunk apiece and some hand-luggage.”</p>

<p>The man rubbed his stubbly beard. “Wal,
I guess I kin stow ye all away and I dunno as
we’ll break down. It’s a big passel o’ folk
to kerry all to oncet when there’s others wants
to go, but git in all of ye, and them as don’t
want to set inside kin set out.”</p>

<p>Immediately there was a rush of six figures
toward the stage.</p>

<p>“Here, here,” cried the old man, “ye ain’t
every namable one o’ ye going to git on top,
air ye? The’ ain’t room for all of ye <i>and</i> the
trunks.”</p>

<p>“Let some of the trunks go inside, then,”
suggested Jo; “they are small,” she said, pausing
in her act of mounting a wheel in order to
clamber on top.</p>

<p>The old man fingered his bit of beard.
“Wal, I dunno. Inside ain’t the place for
trunks; it’s for passengers. Jest you wait a
minute and I’ll see how big them trunks is and
how many kin go on the rumble. Mebbe we
kin make room for everybody. If ye wouldn’t
be so everlastingly in a hurry ye’d have steps
to climb up; they’ve got ’em up at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the hotel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Right ahead.” He pointed with his whip
to a long white house, on the porch of which
several persons were standing waiting for the
stage.</p>

<p>“It’s more fun to climb up this way,” said
Jack clinging to the side of the coach and
feeling for the high step with her toe. “May
I sit by you?” she asked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>The driver chuckled. “What ye want to do
that fur? I ain’t so pretty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’d like to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be bound ye would. All right; you’ve
spoke first. Up ye go,” and he gave her a
boost which sent her to a footing by which she
could reach the seat.</p>

<p>“There’s room for you, too, Jean,” said Jack
reaching down her hands, and with the help of
the others Jean was able to find a place by the
side of her twin.</p>

<p>The driver, meanwhile, had gone to gather
up the trunks, which he brought one by one, and
managed to get the greater number strapped
on behind; the rest he found room for on
top. “There,” he said, “I dunno as we shan’t
make it. Ef them folks at the hotel ain’t got a
lot of big stuff, I guess we kin. The rest of
you gals git up here. Ye kin ride as fur as
the hotel anyway, and ef ye have to git inside
then don’t say I ain’t give ye a ride on top.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Thus adjured, the four remaining girls
mounted to the top and they started off after
a loud “Git ap!” to the horses from the
driver.</p>

<p>Fortunately the passengers next gathered
up were not many: a meek looking woman
with a little girl, and a man, whose only luggage
consisted of that in their hands except a suit
case which was taken inside. With a mighty
crack of the whip and another “Git ap!” off
they started again past green farms, low white
houses, tranquil ponds and running streams,
once in a while clattering through the long
street of a quiet village where a stop would be
made, the mail delivered, a passenger taken up
or set down, and then off again.</p>

<p>Whatever the passengers inside may have
felt, to the company of six girls on top it was a
journey of delight. The two on the front seat
with the driver were in a constant state of
giggle, while the four who sat a-row behind
them were scarcely less mirthful. The driver
informed them his name was Noahdiah Peakes.
“Named after my two grandfathers; one was
Noah, t’ other Obadiah, so they jest combined
’em and give me the two names in one. I git
Noey, gin’rally, though some calls me No,—ole
No Peakes. I made up a conundrum ’bout my
name. Want to hear it?” Of course they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and were asked, “Why am I like a table-land
when I’m to hum?”</p>

<p>“Something about No Peakes,” whispered
Jean to Jack, but they could not guess exactly
and the answer was given: “Becuz there’s
no peaks there,” given with a big laugh and
a slap of the thigh, followed by an immediate
relapse into entire gravity and a “Git ap” to
the horses.</p>

<p>Noahdiah was fond of riddles, they discovered
before they had gone far. His stock
of them lasted all the way to Friendship. Every
now and then he would turn his head over his
shoulder and offer the girls behind him one of
his conundrums such as: “What does a lawyer
do when he’s dead? He lies still. Git ap!” or
“Why is my head like the Artic regions? Becuz
it’s a great white bare place. Git ap!”
Conundrums which touched upon his name, his
personal appearance, his dwelling place, were
the favorites, they discovered, and he was pleased
to boisterousness when Jo made up a new one
at which Nan and Mary Lee groaned, “Why
should we depend upon you in an accident?
Because you are our Maine chance.” He
chuckled and sputtered over this for some time,
forgetting to say “Git ap!” for at least a quarter
of a mile.</p>

<p>At last they were set down at Friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
which they discovered consisted of scarce more
than a farmhouse and a country store. A wagon
would carry them the rest of the way. The
new driver, who, they learned, was the man
about camp, had driven over for them, but
looked a little dubious when he saw the size of
the party. “Guess I’ll have to leave their
traps, Noey,” he said.</p>

<p>“Wal,” answered Noahdiah, “I’d fetch ’em
along myself but I’ve got to git back, and
moreover the stage couldn’t travel them rough
roads. Ain’t Al got no kinder buggy or
nothin’ he kin take some of ’em in? the mother
and the aunt?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go in and see what Al kin do,” responded
the man entering the little store.</p>

<p>“Wisht I could go all the way with ye. I’d
like first-rate to see ye sot down comfortable
before I left ye,” said Noahdiah confidentially.
“I dunno as I ever see a likelier set o’ young
misses come to camp and I’ve fetched over
quite a few. Ye’re real friendly and sociable and
that’s what I like. Some o’ these here prim
old maid schoolmarmy kind don’t open their
lips from Cross Roads to Friendship. You’d
think they was struck dumb, er ef they do
speak it’s like their mouths was one of these here
medicine-droppers; the words come out jest as
though they was squeezed from a rubber bulb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
t’ other end. Here comes Al and ’Lish; now
we’ll see.”</p>

<p>After a short conference it was proposed that
Mrs. Corner and Miss Helen should wait till the
buggy could be made ready when they and
their luggage could follow the wagon, ’Lish
declaring that “six women folks even if they
wasn’t full growed, with luggage” he “cal’lated,”
would about fill a wagon.</p>

<p>“The buggy’ll be more comfortable, marm,”
said Noahdiah, addressing Mrs. Corner, “and
I guess you’ll have the best of it.”</p>

<p>“But three of us in one buggy,” she returned.</p>

<p>“Wal, it’s good and wide, and ye ain’t so
fleshy, neither of ye, and ye kin set clost.” So
there was nothing to do but make the best of it
and either remain till the next day when the
wagon could return for them, or forge ahead in
the manner proposed. The latter course was
finally decided upon and they set out, bumping
over a rough road for three miles before the
camp was reached.</p>

<p>Miss Marshall and Miss Lloyd gave them a
hearty welcome and they sought their quarters
to prepare for supper which they were ready
enough for, after the long drive in the stage
and the added one from the country store.</p>

<p>“Real tents,” cried Jack. “Won’t it be fun?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
I never did sleep in a real tent, Nan. Aren’t they
cozy?”</p>

<p>Two tents, side by side, were given up to the
party of girls, a little log cabin being provided
for Mrs. Corner and Miss Helen. This consisted
of two rooms, one with a fireplace where Mrs.
Corner could have a fire on damp days, a thing
which she felt would be very necessary. There
was another cabin, a larger one, in the centre
of the camp, where the campers could congregate
around a huge log fire on cool evenings
or could sit on wet days. It was really a charming
place with plenty of comfortable chairs, a
big table piled with books and magazines, rugs
on the floor, and at the windows pretty chintz
curtains. A porch ran around on all sides, and
here those who had already arrived were congregated.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so hungry,” said Jean when they
had stowed away a few of their belongings. “I
wonder when we shall have supper.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you and Jack go and find out,”
proposed Nan.</p>

<p>This was a mission highly relished by the
twins, who after a few minutes came back gleefully.
“Supper in fifteen minutes, and we’re
going to have flapjacks and maple syrup,”
cried Jean.</p>

<p>“Yes, and ham and eggs and fried potatoes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
There’s a colored cook and she knows just how
to cook the kind of things we all like; we asked
her.” Jack gave this information.</p>

<p>“And we eat out-of-doors on the verandah
of the big cabin. We saw the tables all set,”
said Jean.</p>

<p>“Lights are out at nine,” Jack went on, “so
we can all go to bed at the same time. We get
up real early; no one wants to sit up late because
they are so healthy tired.”</p>

<p>Nan laughed. “If they are all as healthy
tired as I am I don’t blame them.”</p>

<p>“There are such funny-looking people here,”
Jean continued; “you can’t tell what they really
look like. I saw two or three coming along
from the lake; they had on great big farm hats
and bloomers. They had oars or something
over their shoulders and they looked like huntresses
or Amazons or some such thing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll look just the same ourselves once we
get going,” Mary Lee told her. “It must be
time for supper, girls. Let’s go over.”</p>

<p>The summons came before they were all fairly
ready and one need not doubt that full justice
was done to the ham and eggs, the flapjacks,
the draughts of country milk and the delicious
strawberries and cream.</p>

<p>After supper the new arrivals strolled down
to the lake to see the sun set behind the mountains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and to watch the colors of the sunset sky
reflected in the still waters. Then there was a
little talk in the big living-room but one by one
lapsed into silence, and finally all confessed
that nothing seemed so desirable as the thought
of going to bed, so off they went before nine
o’clock saw the lights all out.</p>

<p>The girls were all up betimes the next morning.
There was so much to do, so many places
to explore, so much to learn.</p>

<p>“I must find some one willing to teach me to
paddle, first thing I do,” announced Nan, “for
I can see that canoeing is going to be the
principal amusement.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to do, too,” Jack decided.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for a day or two before I try my
hand,” Mary Lee resolved. “By that time
some of you all will have learned and can coach
me; meanwhile I will look up the birds; there
must be a great many in so wild a place.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I will do, too,” Jean decided.
She generally adopted Mary Lee’s
suggestions.</p>

<p>So the party divided, Mary Lee, Jean and
Daniella joining in a tramp through the woods,
Jo, Nan and Jack starting forth to take their
first lesson in paddling a canoe; some of the
girls, already old stagers, good-naturedly offering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to teach them. It is not the easiest thing in
the world to learn, and certainly not a thing to
be acquired in one short day, but Nan went
into raptures over the exercise, and went at it
heart and soul, so that before so very long she
could force her canoe forward a short distance
without its turning around and around, and
could manage to get the stroke at least once
out of half a dozen times, so by noon they
returned hungry and elated. A little later came
the second division of the party. These had
discovered a beaver’s dam and were quite delighted
with their morning’s explorations.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the girls take supper down on
the rocks, build a fire and have a jolly time,”
the girls informed Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>“Let’s do that this evening,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t use up all your resources the first
day,” warned Miss Helen. “There is still
novelty in eating out-of-doors on the verandah,
and in living in a tent. Wait till those things
begin to pall upon you.”</p>

<p>“There is the excursion to the mountain;
we must take that while the weather is good.”</p>

<p>“But I would not undertake it right away.
Remember you have several weeks to employ;
I should scatter the novelties at due distances
along the way.”</p>

<p>Acting upon this advice they restrained their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
ardor and spent the remainder of the day in
reverse order; those who had devoted the
morning to the lake, spending the afternoon
in the woods and vice versa, so that it was a
tired lot of girls who were very ready for bed
when nine o’clock came. Mrs. Corner and Miss
Helen had been wise enough not to overfatigue
themselves and had simply rested after their
tiring journey of the day before.</p>

<p>“Those are two right nice girls who were
with us this morning,” Nan told Mary Lee as
they were on their way to the tents.</p>

<p>“And I liked those who were with us this
afternoon,” returned Mary Lee.</p>

<p>Nan laughed. “So we shall not want for
company if we get mad with one another.
There will be no flocking by one’s self and
sulking this trip. There is just a pleasant
number in the camp. We can become acquainted
with them all, and yet there are enough
of us to feel perfectly independent if we want
to go by ourselves. How did you get along
with your paddling?”</p>

<p>“Only fairly well,” returned Mary Lee somewhat
dubiously. “I suppose one can’t expect
perfection at first. Daniella took to it like a
duck. She always does such things well.”</p>

<p>“She is in her element, and doesn’t she
look great in this rough costume?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Yes, you see she was born a maid of the
woods. She is never much of a talker, but
any one can see how happy she is.”</p>

<p>“Yet she can talk, and interestingly, too,
when you get her started.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure, but I fancy she will always
be a little shy.”</p>

<p>They were not up so early the next morning
but that Daniella was before them and out on
the lake practicing with her canoe. She did
indeed look a picture as she stood up in her
short skirt, her big hat shading her radiant
face, her cheeks glowing, and her lovely golden
brown hair gleaming in the sun. “If I were
an artist,” cried Nan, “I would say: Kindly
keep that pose, Miss Scott.”</p>

<p>“Being the next best thing to an artist I
will say it,” said Jo bringing her camera into
focus. “There, I have immortalized you,
Daniella.”</p>

<p>Then Jack declared she wanted Jo to take a
photograph of her in a canoe to send Mr. St.
Nick. Of course Jean could not let this go by
without demanding one of herself in the same
attitude. Mary Lee would like one for Miss
Dolores and Daniella wanted one of Nan for
her own collection, so it ended in various
cameras being brought forth and a series of
pictures being taken; no one was ready to stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
till her first roll of films was exhausted. By
this time they had gone rather far afield.</p>

<p>“It must be getting on,” said Mary Lee,
looking at her watch. “Dear, oh, me, girls. I
should say so. Come to breakfast. Don’t you
smell the delicious fumes of coffee?”</p>

<p>Unencumbered by long skirts, and free of
limb in jumpers and leggings the girls darted
off, racing back to camp full tilt, Jean, though
the most eager as to appetite, the least fleet of
foot, and therefore bringing up the rear.</p>

<small>UP THE MOUNTAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> two or three days the girls decided that
they could no longer wait to join the party
which was preparing for a mountain climb.
The start was made in a wagon which would
take them about twenty miles to the foot of a
steep up-winding road which was only possible
for pedestrians. In bloomers, big hats and
flannel blouses, a leather strap around their
waists upon which was hung a tin cup, and
wearing leathern leggings to protect them from
the briars or something worse, they made ready.
Each had made into a pack a small pillow, a
rubber blanket and a woolen one and had further
provided herself with an alpenstock. There
were about a dozen in the party, which was led
by Miss Lloyd, a cheery little woman full
of resources and with a fund of humor
which would serve a good purpose under difficulties.</p>

<p>“We are to sleep out-of-doors just like
soldiers,” remarked Jack with satisfaction as
she watched the preparations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>’Lish tossed the packs one after another
into the wagon. “Pile in,” he cried, and the
girls obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>“I hope it won’t rain,” remarked Florence
Yardley scanning the sky anxiously.</p>

<p>“Now, Flo, don’t be a wet blanket,” said
her chum, Carrie King. “Suppose it does rain,
who cares?”</p>

<p>“So much more fun,” agreed the rest.</p>

<p>“We haven’t on such flimsy attire that it
will make any difference,” said Bertha Stine.
“What are you kicking about, Floss?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not kicking,” returned Florence
subsiding. “I suppose one may mention a
preference for good weather when our object
is to see the sunrise to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Our object is to have a good time regardless
of weather. If there happens to be a sunrise
that is what we want; if it rains that is
what we want. Isn’t that the proper spirit,
Miss Lloyd?”</p>

<p>“Beautifully proper. I couldn’t ask for a
fairer philosophy than that.”</p>

<p>“And there’s this about it,” Bertha went on.
“If we miss a sunrise this time we can try it
again and still keep our object in anticipation.
In other words if we don’t have our cake and
eat it, we can eat our pie and keep our pudding.
Isn’t that it, girls?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Exactly. ‘So say we all of us,’” they
chanted.</p>

<p>Having stowed away the last pack, seen to
it that the provisions were safe and at the last
moment going back for a water bucket, ’Lish
at last gathered up his reins and off they started
waving merry farewells and making the woods
ring with a gay song which went something
like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“When ’Lisha takes us ’way from camp</div>
<div class="verse">We use a bright blue wagon,</div>
<div class="verse">And each girl cries ‘What lovely roads!’</div>
<div class="verse">Though they’re not much to brag on.</div>
<div class="indent3">Thanky ma’am.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of each stanza the girls rose to
their feet and sat down again violently, crying
in chorus, “Thanky ma’am!” Every now and
then some one contributed a new verse which
was sung lustily.</p>

<p>“It prevents our getting cramped from long
sitting,” explained Bertha. “It is also good
for our lungs and keeps up our spirits.”</p>

<p>Once in a while as they came to a steep hill
some of the party would get out and walk, and
when a wayside spring appeared there was a
scramble to fill the tin cups.</p>

<p>By sundown the foot of the mountain was
reached and preparations were made for supper.
Brushwood was plentiful, therefore a fire was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
readily managed. Miss Lloyd produced a frying-pan
in which slices of bacon soon sizzled.
Carrie King was delegated to watch the coffee
which began to boil over and was rescued only
after heroic efforts. Then the girls fell to and
ate heartily, deciding that coffee from tin cups
was not so bad after all and that bacon and
bread made a dish fit for any king, “including
Carrie,” remarked Bertha.</p>

<p>“Apple turnovers!” exclaimed Jean. “Oh,
Miss Lloyd, what a nice supper.”</p>

<p>“Crackers and cheese, please, ma’am,” called
out Jo.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a cookie.” Jack made known her
choice.</p>

<p>There was milk for those who preferred it
and water from a spring near by.</p>

<p>It was almost dark by the time they had
finished their meal. The stars began peeping
from a rack of clouds; a little stream tinkled
on its way from the mountain to the lake; an
owl hooted in the distance. The girls spread
their rubber blankets on the ground and without
undressing, pulled their woolen covers over
them, each having selected the softest spot she
could find.</p>

<p>But in spite of the long ride, the excitement
of such an unusual experience kept Nan awake,
and she lay looking up at the stars twinkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
down at her. The clouds were drifting away
and from the blue spaces one after another a
golden eye appeared. For a long time she
lay thinking, but finally she fell asleep. She
was roused after a while by hearing suppressed
giggles from Jack who lay next her. She sat
up, leaned over and whispered, “What’s the
matter, Jack? Haven’t you been asleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack, also in a whisper, “but I
was wakened up by something walking over
me. I was a tiny bit scared and then I saw
such a funny little animal sitting by me and
looking at me with such a ridiculous expression
that I had to laugh. When you moved it went
off. What do you reckon it was?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine. What did it look like?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell, for it wasn’t light enough for
me to see very well. I could only make out
its funny little face. It wasn’t a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Nor a fox?”</p>

<p>“No, not so big.”</p>

<p>They sat up watching for the return of the
little beast, but it was evidently not in a humor
for making a second visit, so finally, getting
drowsy, the two sisters moved nearer one
another and in a short time fell asleep, not to
waken till a call from Miss Lloyd announced
that they must begin their mountain climb.</p>

<p>Then the identity of the mysterious visitor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
was discovered, for he had left a token of his
presence in the shape of a porcupine quill which
Jack found sticking in her blanket. She
proudly secured it as a souvenir after finding
out from ’Lish what it was.</p>

<p>“There’s quite a few of them porcupines
around here,” the man told her, “and they
ain’t so pleasant to meet up with sometimes, for
they can throw their quills quite disagreeable.
You was lucky not to git that in some part of
your body ’stid of in your blanket.”</p>

<p>It was a long and arduous climb up the
mountain. Two or three of the party, Jean
among them, gave out and waited on the roadside
till the others should come down. The
rest reached the top just in time to see the red
ball of the sun enter a bank of clouds.</p>

<p>“There; I knew it would rain,” exclaimed
Florence.</p>

<p>“Where’s any rain?” demanded Carrie.</p>

<p>“You’ll see,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“I suppose we may not rest too long,” said
Miss Lloyd, “for I fear Florence may be right
and that we are in for a rain.”</p>

<p>They had taken a slight breakfast before
making their climb, and decided not to stop for
anything more till they had gone a little further
on where they could find shelter in case of a
shower, so after they had been joined by those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
waiting half-way they did not tarry to rest but
continued the downward path.</p>

<p>They had scarcely gone many rods before
they met a party of people going up; two men
and two young women, the former in spotless
flannels and neatly polished shoes, the latter in
fresh white frocks, rose-wreathed hats and filmy
veils. They looked very natty and fine. As
they passed they gave supercilious stares at
the company of girls in stout shoes, farmer
hats and flannel blouses.</p>

<p>“But, oh, dear me,” said Jo to Nan, “what a
get up for the mountains. Do they think they
are at Bar Harbor, forsooth, or do they expect
to find a hotel around the next boulder? Imagine
what they will look like when they have
gone through brambles and thickets and over
dewy grass. I shouldn’t like to pay their
laundry bills.”</p>

<p>“It’s raining,” exclaimed Florence as the first
fugitive drops began to patter. “What did I
say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Floss, we can stand the rain better than
we can your torrent of I-told-you-sos,” said
Carrie.</p>

<p>“Who cares if it does rain?” queried Jo.
“We aren’t wearing white frocks and rosebud
hats. If you want to hear any growling, I would
advise seeking that party of silly-billies who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
have just passed us. It won’t matter if we do
get wet.” But by the time they had reached
their camping place of the night before the rain
was coming down in good earnest and they
were glad to seek shelter in a little hut not far
off.</p>

<p>“You can at least be under cover there,”
Miss Lloyd told them. “We must have something
to eat first thing, for I am sure you are
all half starved with nothing but sandwiches
since before dawn. I will make some coffee
and fry some bacon, so you can have a little
something hot.”</p>

<p>“Where? There’s no chimney in here,”
said Florence. The girls stood peeping into
the little cabin which was open to them.</p>

<p>“You’ll see. Go in, go in. You look like a
flock of drabbled hens standing before a hen-coop,”
Miss Lloyd laughed. “Shoo! Shoo!”</p>

<p>The girls skurried in out of the wet to find a
very primitive sort of house with earthen floor
and rough log sides. A couple of benches and
a stool were all the furniture. A small window
let in the light on one side.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty poor comfort to sit in wet clothes,”
complained Florence. “I’ve no doubt I shall
take my death.”</p>

<p>“You might if you had a cotton frock on.
You’re no worse off than the rest of us,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Bertha. “What did you come to camp for,
anyway, Floss?”</p>

<p>“Not to get wet.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you ought to have stayed at
home. It’s part of the performance. With a
good dry bench to sit on and a roof over you
what more do you want? Look at Miss Lloyd
out there; she has actually started a fire and
there she is in this downpour acting as if she
were really going to cook something. Did you
ever?”</p>

<p>“The fire is burning, too, of all things,” exclaimed
Jo looking out. “She has made a sort
of oven, you see, but why doesn’t the smoke get
into her eyes?”</p>

<p>“Because she keeps away from the windy
side. Isn’t she a duck?”</p>

<p>“She must be, not to mind the wet,” returned
Jo. “I’m going out to help her, being seized
with a desire to be a duck, too.”</p>

<p>She went out leaving the others to watch the
ingenious manipulation of the frying-pan.
They all crowded around the one small window
to watch proceedings. Presently from the
opposite direction they heard voices and the
doorway was darkened by the figure of a man.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he began hesitatingly,
“would you mind very much if we came in?”</p>

<p>The girls huddled around the window turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to see the party they had encountered on the
way down the mountain, but in what a forlorn
and unhappy state. The crisp white frocks
were drenched and stained, the red of rose had
run into the green of ribbon on the flower-trimmed
hats, the thin stockings fairly oozed
water and the natty tan shoes were sodden and
muddy. The men looked scarcely less limp
than their companions, for their straw hats were
out of shape, their trousers soaking, their collars
flabby from the moisture which trickled from
their hats.</p>

<p>“Oh, come in if you like,” said Bertha, who,
in her prerogative as eldest, was spokesman
for the rest. “You can probably find a dry
end of plank somewhere.”</p>

<p>The place was small and the benches already
nearly occupied, but the newcomers promptly
took possession of what remained for them and
sat in stony and miserable silence watching the
rain pour down.</p>

<p>Presently Jo appeared, gaily bearing a large
wooden platter of bacon in one hand and a
carefully held paper bag in the other. “Here
you are,” she cried, “smoking hot! Come
a-running! Oh!” She stopped short at the
unexpected apparition of the new arrivals and
looked so taken aback that her friends all
giggled. But it was only for a moment that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Jo was nonplussed. It might have been a
restaurant and the girls of her own party the
guests upon whom she alone waited, for all the
attention she gave the four huddled on the
bench near the door. “Bacon and rolls for
eight,” she began again. “I hope, ladies, you
will not criticize the bacon, but the fact is our
chimney is smoky and the cook says you must
excuse it if she has scorched it a bit. I am
sorry, too, to announce that a burglar broke in
last night and stole all our silver, so if you will
kindly adapt yourselves to the familiar adage,
‘fingers were made before forks,’ I think you will
get on very well. The second course is on its
way.” She passed around the bacon and the
bag of rolls. Each girl was hungry enough to
be glad of anything to eat.</p>

<p>As she paused before Bertha she said something
in a low tone. Bertha peeped into the
bag and then nodded. Jo removed two of the
rolls and laid them aside, then picking up the
plate of bacon she went toward the four forlornities
and said, “Would you like some of
this? I’m sorry we can’t offer you a Delmonico
feast but it’s better than a feast of Barmecide.”</p>

<p>One of the young men looked brightly up
and said heartily, “That’s awfully good of
you. I am afraid we shall be robbing you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“No, there are more eatables outside when
we can get at them. I believe our man is drying
them out or something. We’ll be glad if
you will accept this slight token of our hospitable
intentions.”</p>

<p>The young man took the plate and passed
it to his neighbor. “Won’t you have some,
Mabel?” he asked.</p>

<p>She looked at the charred edges of the bacon
scornfully.</p>

<p>“I never eat burnt food,” she answered.</p>

<p>The young man flushed up. “You’ll have
some, Kitty,” he continued, passing the plate to
the other young woman.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she said a little more graciously
and helped herself to the most appetizing looking
piece.</p>

<p>“Mabel” deigned to take a roll at which she
nibbled gingerly, “as if expecting it to poison
her,” commented Jack to her twin. The first
young man, however, seemed genuinely glad
of what came his way and was profuse in his
thanks. “Kitty” expressed herself faintly
grateful. The second young man also gave
reluctant thanks, “But he ate all he could get,
just the same,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Jo did not wait to consume her own roll but
took it with her as she went out. As she
passed him the first young man sprang to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
feet. “Can’t I be of some service?” he asked.
“You are so kind to share with us. I wish you
would let me be of some assistance.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” returned Jo. “Our man
is outside and is very capable,” and out she
went.</p>

<p>After a time she appeared at the little window.
“Girls,” she whispered, “’Lish has rigged up
an awning, out of the rubber blankets, for the
wagon, and has some dry straw in it. The
rest of the eatables are quite dry and Miss Lloyd
thinks we’d better not attempt to transport
them here in all the rain. Don’t you think we
might leave the castle to the lords and ladies
and take to the tented plain?”</p>

<p>Every girl immediately made for the door in
a jiffy, without so much as a word of farewell
to the uninvited guests, and in another moment
the four silent strangers had the place to themselves
while the girls under ’Lish’s improvised
shelter made merry over ginger ale, hard-boiled
eggs, biscuits and cakes. The coffee had come
to grief through the sudden giving way of one
of the stones which propped the coffee-pot, and
Miss Lloyd was unable to save more than a
cupful which all insisted she should drink herself.</p>

<p>In the goodness of her heart Miss Lloyd proposed
that they should send some of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
abundance to “those that sit in darkness,”
she said, but every girl’s voice was raised in
protest.</p>

<p>“Horrid, disagreeable, stuck-up creatures,”
cried they, “not a crumb shall they have.
They have already had enough to keep them
from starving, and they may thank their stars
they had that much; it was more than they
deserved. Why didn’t they provide themselves
with some food, foolish things?”</p>

<p>“They probably meant to go over the
mountain and on to the next village, but
the rain altered their plans,” Miss Lloyd
said.</p>

<p>“Then let them take the consequences. If
they had behaved like white folks we’d have
been ready to divvy up with them,” said Jo.
“Although,” she added, “I must say the first
young man was very nice. If we could have
toled him away from the rest I shouldn’t
care.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” remarked Mary Lee with
meaning.</p>

<p>Jo made a face at her and subsided.</p>

<p>The rain continued for the rest of the day,
but ’Lish proposed that they “jog along
toward home,” keeping themselves under the
rubber blanket canopy. So, toward dusk a
chorus of cheerful voices was heard by those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
anxiously waiting at camp. The voices were
singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“When ’Lisha brings us home to camp,</div>
<div class="verse">All in the driving rain, sirs,</div>
<div class="verse">You’ll maybe look for frowns and groans,</div>
<div class="verse">But you will look in vain, sirs.</div>
<div class="indent3">Thanky ma’am.”</div>

<small>CANOEING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> pastime was so popular at camp as canoeing.
To send the light, graceful barks over the
smooth waters of the lake to some favorite
shadowy nook where glimpses of the mountains
appeared between the waving branches of the
trees, to spend an hour then with a book, or
to watch the birds, or perhaps only to lie at
full length on the grass and dream, and then
to take up the paddles again, all this was exactly
the kind of thing which appealed to every one
of the girls.</p>

<p>“I think you might sometimes let me go
with you,” said Jack one morning to her eldest
sister. “You never seem to think I ever want
to be with any one but Jean. Of course I am
fond of Jean, but I am just as fond of you, and
half the time she wants to do something I don’t
want to do, so I think you might take me out
in your canoe.”</p>

<p>“How do you know but that I shall want
to do something you don’t want to do?” returned
Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Well, I’d be no worse off,” maintained Jack.
Nan laughed and Jack felt that her case was
won, but she added, “Besides, you promised
to teach me how to paddle and you never have
done it. I never have a chance to paddle because
the older girls always want to do it.
Everybody says you are a fine paddler, Nan.”</p>

<p>“And you are a fine tease as well as a
flatterer,” responded Nan. “All right, kitten,
I’ll take you, and may I not live to regret it.”</p>

<p>The final clause had no effect upon Jack
who, having gained her point, went off well
satisfied and was waiting at the lake when her
sister appeared, paddles over her shoulder and
book under her arm.</p>

<p>“Are you going to read to me?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” returned Nan with emphasis.
“One would think you were an infant in arms.
You can provide your own entertainment. I
didn’t invite you on this expedition, you may
remember. If I waste my energies showing
you how to paddle I am fulfilling all my part
of the bargain. Get in, and don’t tumble all
over yourself or you will upset.”</p>

<p>They started off in fine style, Nan really
becoming interested in giving instructions to
her apt pupil who tried hard to heed her warnings
of “Not that way. Don’t use your paddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
like that. Don’t you see you only turn around
and around and will never get on? Take
care. Bear on more weight. That’s it; now,”
and so on till Jack finally caught the swing
and kept steadily at it in unison with Nan’s
“one, two, three.”</p>

<p>At last the canoe swung around into a
sheltered inlet where overhanging boughs
fairly touched the water and a little stream
emptied itself into the lake. Here Nan announced
she would go ashore. “Now,” she
said to Jack, “you can do anything you choose
except fool with the canoe. I forbid that.
You can go berrying, or fish, or study birds
or do anything reasonable like that. I am
going to read.” She settled herself comfortably
in a small depression between the roots of
a far-reaching tree and left Jack to her own
devices.</p>

<p>Jack’s devices, be it said, were seldom like
other people’s, and on this occasion her inclination
was to follow up the tinkling stream till
she came to a rotten log fallen across the water.
Upon this, it struck her, she would experiment
to see how far she could venture without the
log’s giving way. “Even if it should break
and I went in,” she said to herself, “I couldn’t
get very wet, for the stream isn’t at all deep.”
The log proving stronger than she anticipated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the excitement of the enterprise soon faded
away and she sought out other employment.
She tried to catch in her hands the little silvery
minnows which darted through the clear water,
but they were too fleet and too wary. She
listened to the birds and recognized the notes
of several. Then she climbed the bank and
went afield for berries. She discovered a clump
of bushes from which she garnered quite a treasure.
These she carried in her hat to share with
Nan, but before she reached the tree where Nan
was sitting she decided to pin some leaves together
in the form of a basket to be filled with
the berries she had gathered. This occupied
some time. Nan accepted the offering very
graciously, but was too absorbed in her book
to notice more than that Jack had found entertainment
and to feel satisfaction in the fact.</p>

<p>“I wish I had brought a book,” murmured
Jack, as she consumed her last berry and perceived
that Nan was not to be inveigled into a
protracted conversation.</p>

<p>She tried climbing a tree, getting very warm,
and sticky from the gum, as it happened to be
a spruce-tree, and not feeling much ambition to
try a second climb, she went down to the
lake where the canoe lay and regarded it
thoughtfully. She looked up to where her sister
sat some distance away. “She didn’t say I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
wasn’t to get into it; she only told me not to
fool with it. It won’t do any harm just to sit
in it,” she said to herself. She drew the canoe
in and stepped over the side, then tried to push
off, but to do this she found she must use a
paddle. This she did, and presently found herself
afloat. It was a delightful sensation, and
she decided that since she had gone thus far
she would make use of her opportunities and
would practice paddling for a little while. “I
don’t see why I shouldn’t,” she told herself.
“I don’t have to obey Nan; she isn’t my mother,
and I will never learn if I don’t practice. The
big girls want the canoes all the time, and it’s
so seldom I get such a chance.” She stood up
and was soon sending the canoe jerkily through
the water.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun had found its way through
the boughs of the tree to Nan’s book, falling
directly on its pages. She looked up. “It
must be nearly noon,” she said; “the sun is
almost directly overhead. We must get back
if we are to be in time for dinner. Jack!” she
called, rising to her feet.</p>

<p>There was no answer, and she turned toward
the little stream which ran through the field
where she knew Jack had gathered the berries,
but no Jack responded to her repeated calls.
“Where in the world can the child have gone?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
murmured Nan. She went toward the lake,
following its brink till she came to the spot
where the canoe had been left. There was not
even the canoe. Lifting her eyes she saw at
some distance away, Jack paddling lustily,
though rather ineffectually. Curving her hands
each side her mouth, Nan gave the long call
which the campers used for their signal. Jack
heard and gave answer. Nan beckoned vigorously.
Jack evidently was making an effort to
return, but in her anxiety to do so she lost the
little skill she had acquired and could only turn
the canoe helplessly around.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” said Nan, “if I could only swim
I’d try to get out to her, for she never can bring
the thing in that way; she might try all day.”
She looked up and down the lake to see if other
canoes were in sight, but it so happened that
those who had been out had already returned
that they might not miss the noon meal, it being
later than Nan realized. There was only
one of two things to be done; either walk back
to camp or wait till some one appeared. After
a moment’s thought Nan decided to wait, for
she did not want to desert Jack. “If anything
were to happen to her I’d never forgive myself,”
she said. “No doubt some one will be coming
along after a while.” She sat down where she
could see Jack’s manœuvres. She was still too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
far away to give any orders which might be
heard as the wind was in the wrong direction
to bear her voice distinctly, and it was after repeated
efforts to make Jack hear and understand
that she gave up trying.</p>

<p>Jack struggled for a while and then sat forlornly
and let the canoe drift. Nan watched
anxiously. If it should strike a snag or if Jack
should move unwarily and upset the canoe what
could Nan do? Her anger at Jack’s disobedience
was lost in apprehension. Further, further
on the little boat drifted, very slowly, for
there was not a strong current. Nan arose and
walked along the bank that she might keep
opposite her sister, feeling that she must be as
near as possible, at the same time realizing that
she would be powerless in case of any accident.
She registered a vow that she would learn to
swim forthwith that she might be ready for such
emergencies.</p>

<p>After what seemed an unconscionable time
she heard the faint sound of voices coming
nearer and nearer, and around the bend she saw
a canoe coming with two girls in it. Again
Nan gave the call, which was answered
promptly, and presently she could distinguish
Jo and Daniella, who directly made their way
to where Nan stood.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” was Jo’s greeting. “What are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
you doing up here by yourself, and why didn’t
you come back to dinner? I thought Jack was
with you.”</p>

<p>“Jack was,” replied Nan, “but there’s where
she is now,” and she pointed to where the canoe
was drifting.</p>

<p>“The little monkey! Do you mean to say
she took your canoe off and left you no way of
getting back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I could have walked, but I didn’t want
to leave her up here alone. You see she’s lost
her head and can’t do a thing with the canoe,
so she is just letting it drift. She managed all
right at first, but when she tried to get back she
became so scared that she forgot all I had told
her. I couldn’t get to her nor she to me, but I
didn’t want to leave her absolutely in the lurch.
Is dinner over?”</p>

<p>“Yes, long ago. We came away just after.
We all came to the conclusion that you two had
taken something with you and had preferred to
picnic. It’s a burning shame.”</p>

<p>“I do feel the pangs of hunger,” acknowledged
Nan, “although we had some berries a while
ago, but they are not very satisfying. Could
you girls go out there and bring that little sinner
back, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. Come, Daniella,” and Jo
turned the canoe in Jack’s direction. So before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
very long Jack was rescued from her unpleasant
situation, and was brought back a repentant
culprit to her sister.</p>

<p>Now that her sister was out of danger Nan
felt her anger returning, and after giving one
withering look at the offender, she turned to her
friends and said: “We’ll not keep you, girls,
for I know you are out for a good time. We’ll
go back and see if we can find anything to eat.
I am almost starved.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will get no dinner,” Jo
said. “You know the rule is ‘no meals after
hours,’ and you know how cross old Hetty
is if she is disturbed when she has cleared
away.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk her crossness,” returned Nan lightly.
“She can’t do more than refuse me. Thanks,
girls, for coming to the rescue.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the canoe and pushed off,
not deigning to give Jack a word.</p>

<p>Very meekly sat Jack. “Won’t you forgive
me, Nan?” she asked after a while. But she
might have spoken to a graven image for all
Nan gave sign of hearing, and Jack lapsed into
silence, though at intervals she repeated her
question plaintively.</p>

<p>Once arrived at camp, Nan shouldered the
paddles and marched directly to her tent, Jack
meekly following. The place seemed deserted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Both girls knew that this was the time for their
mother’s afternoon nap. Most of the girls were
off on some expedition, and upon inquiry they
learned that even ’Lish had gone away with
the wagon. Hetty was not to be found, so
there seemed nothing to do but “grin and
bear it.”</p>

<p>In her various excursions hither and thither
about the camp grounds, Nan had kept up the
same stony attitude toward Jack who followed
closely at her heels, but at the conclusion of the
unprofitable search she at last broke forth into
speech. “As if it weren’t enough for you to
worry me nearly to death by being out there
alone.” She began turning her vials of wrath
upon Jack. “Those canoes are the most ticklish
things, and if you had happened to upset
nothing could have saved you. You couldn’t
swim, neither could I. You would have been
drowned before my very eyes.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been, if you are going to talk
to me that way,” replied Jack tearfully. “I
was just going to practice a little, and got along
beautifully at first till I got scared about getting
back.”</p>

<p>“Practice! I wish you’d not take it into your
head to practice quite so near dinner time. I
suppose I shall be laid up with a headache from
going without food for so long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Oh, Nan, I <i>am</i> sorry,” answered Jack wofully.
“I’m hungry, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to be.” And Nan turned
scornfully away, going within her tent and forbidding
Jack to follow her.</p>

<p>Left alone Jack took counsel with herself.
What could she do to propitiate Nan? It was
a very rare occasion when Nan turned upon her
in this way. Usually it was this sister who
screened her and acted as a buffer when others
were making attacks, so it was all the more terrible
to have Nan so very, very angry. It was
because she was hungry, no doubt. All persons
were cross when they were hungry. If she
could find something to eat, she might perhaps
gain forgiveness. She took her courage in her
hand and invaded the kitchen, but all was clean
and orderly, not even a crust of bread to be
seen. Jack wondered if it would be wrong to
pursue her investigations as far as the pantry,
but even if her conscience had allowed her she
found the door closed and locked between this
place and the kitchen. Next she thought of
hunting up Miss Lloyd or Miss Marshall, but
Miss Lloyd had gone away, she learned from
Florence Yardley who had declined to join the
expedition which Miss Lloyd had headed. Miss
Marshall was lying down. Some of the girls
were still on hand, Florence informed her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
one or two of the ladies, not Miss Helen; she
had gone with the others, so had Mary Lee and
Jean.</p>

<p>Rather than explain why she and Nan had
not had dinner, Jack moved off to continue her
consideration of the situation and at last determined
upon a course which she proceeded to
carry out.</p>

<p>Three hours later, Nan, having somewhat
recovered her equanimity, appeared at her
mother’s cabin. “Where is Jack?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Corner.
“I thought she was with you.”</p>

<p>“So she was, but——” Nan told her tale.</p>

<p>“I am so thankful she wasn’t drowned,”
said Mrs. Corner sighing, “that I can’t think
of anything else just now, but poor Nan, had
you no dinner?”</p>

<p>“Not a mouthful. Oh well, it is only an
hour to supper time. I can stand it, I reckon.
I’ll go see what has become of Jack. One cannot
yet trust her out of sight, you see. I’ll
tether her to a tree next time I take her canoeing,
that is, if we land anywhere, otherwise it
won’t be necessary.”</p>

<p>“I really think Jack is old enough to stop
such tricks,” said Mrs. Corner. “We could
excuse it when she was younger, but she ought
to be gaining some discretion at her age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“She has lots more than she used to have;
she seldom gets into any awful scrape, and it
used to be a daily occurrence.” For all her
morning’s experience Nan was ready as usual
to take up the cudgels in Jack’s defense.
“Where are the others?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Gone off to Pine Knob, at least some of
them have.”</p>

<p>“We met Danny and Jo going up the lake;
but for them I suppose Jack would still have
been drifting.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it, Nan; it makes me shudder
to think what might have happened. I shall
forbid Jack’s ever going out without some older
and more experienced person.”</p>

<p>“That is just what you’d better do. There is
one thing to be said for Jack; she always minds
what you tell her, even though she doesn’t have
the same respect for my orders. The girls will
be back soon. I will go hunt up Jack and send
her to you.”</p>

<p>She went out, searched the camp from one
end to the other, but no Jack. Florence
Yardley had seen her and reported the conversation.
Hetty had returned to her duties
but had seen no Jack. Nan went along the
path and entered the country road leading to
the village. Jack might have gone to meet the
wagon which would return that way. Looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
down the road she did see, not the wagon, but
some one coming along slowly, a figure which
she presently recognized as Jack’s. In a few
minutes she came up, hot, dusty, travel worn.
Her hands were full of packages. At sight of
Nan she set down one of her paper bags and
wiped her perspiring face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan,” she cried joyfully, “I hoped
I’d meet you before I did any one else. Come
right over here under these trees. I’ve brought
you something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Brought me something to eat?” cried Nan
in astonishment. “Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“At the village. There’s a right nice store
there, you know.”</p>

<p>“At the village? Why that is three miles
away. You don’t mean to say you have walked
there and back, six miles? I should think you
would be dead beat, this warm afternoon.”</p>

<p>Jack’s lip trembled. “It was right far,” she
acknowledged, “but I knew I’d made you miss
your dinner and I didn’t want you to have a
headache; besides I wanted to punish myself.”</p>

<p>“You poor little midget,” exclaimed Nan,
gathering the culprit to her and kissing the
flushed cheek.</p>

<p>The tears sprang to Jack’s eyes, and she
turned away saying, “I’m so glad you forgive
me. Please eat something,” she added earnestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
as she opened her packages to display a
nondescript collection of stale cakes, hard
candies and uncertain fruit.</p>

<p>Whatever Nan may have thought of the
quality of the feast provided, she gave no sign,
but did her best by it, and if Jo was surprised
to see how small an appetite Nan had for her
supper, there was no reason given for it then,
but it was explained later and at the same time
Jo and Daniella were begged not to tell the
others of the morning’s misadventure.</p>

<p>So peace was restored. Jack had punished
herself, and if tired in body, was at least serene
in mind when she went to bed that night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A RAINY DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Raining!</span>” exclaimed Mary Lee in disgusted
tones one morning as she put her head
out between the flaps of the tent. “Now what
are we going to do, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’ll be something to do,” returned
Jo who was arranging her hair before the small
mirror. She and Daniella were Mary Lee’s
tent-mates. “It will excite our imagination and
invention and give us a little variety. We’ve
managed to spend other rainy days to advantage,
why not this?”</p>

<p>“Such a philosopher,” remarked Daniella
shaking out her bright locks. “It’s bound not
to be dull where you are, Jo.”</p>

<p>Jo dropped a curtsey and went on with her
toilet, talking all the time.</p>

<p>Daniella, having tied her thick braids neatly,
went to the door of the tent. “My, it suttenly
do rain, as Mitty would say. We’ll need umbrellas
in order to get to breakfast, which of
course will be indoors on such a morning.”</p>

<p>“Umbrellas, nothing,” responded Jo. “I
shall put on my golf cape and run between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the drops. I expect to be out in the rain half
the day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jo, do you?” This from Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Of course. What’s the use of being in a
free and easy place if you can’t be free and
easy? Where is the use of rubber boots,
bloomers and flannel blouses if you can’t wear
them? Me for the dribbling woods, the squishy
paths, the oozy road.” It was on such occasions
that Jo reverted to hilarious slang.</p>

<p>“Then I’m with you,” said Daniella selecting
her dingiest and shortest skirt.</p>

<p>“Count me in, too,” added Mary Lee.
“There, I’m ready for the fray,” she said
buckling a leather belt around her trim little
waist and picking up her golf cape. “I’ll run
next door and see what Nan is thinking
about.”</p>

<p>“Give my love to her and tell her to study
up her fire motive; we’ll want it later in the
day,” said Jo.</p>

<p>Mary Lee found Nan already dressed and
hunting around for her rubber boots. Jean
and Jack occupied the tent with her and they,
too, were on hands and knees looking under
the cots for the lost articles.</p>

<p>“What are you all doing?” asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Looking for my rubber boots,” Nan told
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“Sillies! Don’t you remember, Nan, you
lent them to Florence Yardley one day? She
probably hasn’t returned them. I’ll go over
and get them as long as I am prepared for wet
weather.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks,” said Nan gratefully. “That
is good of you, Mary Lee. Never mind, kiddies,
they’re probably across the street.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty wet street,” said Jean looking
out at the drenched path upon which the drops
were steadily pouring from the overhanging
trees. “What are you going to do, Nan, to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sit by the fire and spin, I suppose. It
will be a good day in which to darn stockings,
write letters, mend, and read.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” cried Jack. “Such hateful
things, all but the reading, and one gets tired
of that all day. What are you going to do,
Jean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I can’t think so crickly.
Probably I shall find a lot of things. I’ve a
puzzle picture I’ve been saving.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so have I. I forgot them.”</p>

<p>“And I may write to Mr. St. Nick.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll write to Carter. That’s two
things. We might invent a game, Jean; we’ve
always intended to and now is our chance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we might do that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Here Mary Lee returned with the boots in
her hand. “Florence says she is very sorry
she forgot to return them, though it is my
opinion she was about to put them on to wear
to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Lee, you’re so suspicious!”
Nan reproved her.</p>

<p>“Well, why were they right there on the
floor?”</p>

<p>“Maybe she was going to bring them over
to me as she came by.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed Mary Lee expressively.
She had not much love for Miss Yardley, who,
a little older than the Corner girls, treated
Mary Lee especially with as magnificent a
superiority as her two years’ seniority would
allow. “Jo and Danny say they don’t mind
the rain at all,” said Mary Lee after a moment,
sitting down on Nan’s trunk to watch her
sister draw on the boots. “So we’re going
into the woods just as usual. We’ve prepared
for it and if we get soaking, why, we will just
stand it, and when we get back we can put on
dry things.”</p>

<p>“I think that will be fine,” declared Jack.
“I’ll do that, too, Jean.”</p>

<p>But Jean was too fastidious to care about
getting wet and decided she would prefer to
remain under cover. She tipped along daintily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
under an umbrella when the others, regardless
of weather, rushed to the log cabin where
breakfast was spread, and she took much satisfaction
in announcing that she didn’t get a bit
wet.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Jack triumphantly; “my feet
are soaked.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t wear rubbers?” said her
mother.</p>

<p>“No, mother, what was the use? I shall
get a great deal wetter pretty soon, and besides
my rubber boots have a hole in them,
and it makes it a lot worse than having none
at all.”</p>

<p>“But they are quite new, Jack.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I cut them on the rocks, I
think, one day when I was wading in the lake.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t think you should go out then.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” put in Miss Helen. “It
won’t hurt her to get wet if she doesn’t get
chilled, and if she will change her clothes as
soon as she comes in.” So Jack was allowed
to go.</p>

<p>About half a dozen or more girls started off
for a walk in the rain after breakfast, Jack the
most enthusiastic of them all. She returned
barefooted and joyous, though drenched to the
skin, as were the others, who declared they had
never enjoyed anything more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“It was just like being an animal,” Jack told
her mother; “a fox or a duck or something,
for you didn’t have to think of your clothes and
you didn’t care how wet you got. It was lovely
to feel the rain in your face and trickling down
your back.”</p>

<p>“It must have been,” laughed Mrs. Corner,
“though the trickles down the back don’t appeal
to me materially. That part doesn’t sound
very delightful.”</p>

<p>“It was though,” maintained Jack, spreading
out her toes to the blaze of her mother’s open
fire. “And another thing is,” she went on;
“when you get so very wet it’s so nice to be
getting dry, just like when you are tired it is
nice to get rested, or when you are hungry it is
nice to eat. We had a lovely time, Jean. We
hollered just as loud as we could, and we saw
another porcupine.”</p>

<p>“What was he doing?” asked Jean, immediately
interested.</p>

<p>“He was down by a little black pool. Nan
said it was ink that was in it and that he had
gone there to write a letter with one of his
quills. She said he would dip it in and write
on a big leaf.”</p>

<p>“How could he when the leaves were all
wet?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p126">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">It was Just Like Being a Duck.</span>”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jack threw back her head and laughed joyously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
“Of course he couldn’t do it at all, wet
leaves or dry, you silly little goose. Nan just
said that, but he did roll himself into a funny
ball, all spikey, when he saw us. We were
going as far as the beaver dam but most of the
girls wanted to come back, so we came.”</p>

<p>“Where are they all?”</p>

<p>“Over in the big living-room, I think. They
were all going there. Let us go, too, Jean.
Maybe they will be having some fun we might
be missing.”</p>

<p>Jean quickly agreed, and Jack having donned
dry clothes was content to seek the big cabin
under shelter of an umbrella.</p>

<p>In the big living-room with its huge stone
fireplace, most of the campers were congregated.
A fine log fire leaped and snapped
cheerily. Around the large table half a dozen
girls were seated writing; some others were
reading near the windows, while on the skins
spread upon the floor before the hearth were
those who had been Jack’s companions during
the walk to the woods. As usual, Jo had the
floor, and was making them all laugh by an
account of some of her exploits at school.</p>

<p>Jack seated herself on the outskirts of the
group and picked up a dictionary which Daniella
had carried over. She turned the pages
thoughtfully and presently said to Jean, “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
I had another dictionary I could invent a
game.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another one,” said Jo, handing over
a small black volume. “I’m never safe without
it. Tell us about your game, kiddie. Perhaps
we’ll all take a hand. Fire ahead.”</p>

<p>“Well, but you see you would all have to
have dictionaries.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can scare up enough. Go on
and tell us first and then we’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Jack, “it’s this way: You
choose a letter of the alphabet and then you
take a certain number of the hardest words you
come to, say ten words; they must be awfully
hard that the others aren’t liable to know the
meaning of, and then you write something
using the words in what you write, then the
rest have to guess what the words mean. The
one who guesses the greatest number gets the
game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Nan thoughtfully. “That’s
not bad, kitten. Suppose we try it just to see
how it goes. Dictionaries! Dictionaries! Who
has a dictionary, or two? Don’t all speak at
once.”</p>

<p>By dint of inquiry and search as many
as eight dictionaries were discovered and
handed around to those who cared to try the
game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Now,” said Nan, “the letters will have to
be chosen or allotted, or something.”</p>

<p>“You begin, then, Nan, with A,” proposed
Jo. “I’ll take B, next fellow C, and so on down
the line.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan. We’ll adopt your suggestion,
Miss Keyes.”</p>

<p>“We must have paper and pencils, of
course,” Jo went on. “I’ll go see what I can
scare up.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Helen has pencils galore, and writing
pads, too,” Nan sang out after her.</p>

<p>“Very well,” responded Jo, and she was off
in a twinkling to return directly with the necessary
articles.</p>

<p>Nan had been thinking over the game.
“There is another way we could do,” she said.
“We could begin by having one person do the
writing, incorporating the ten words, as it were;
each person could then have a copy and all
guess the same words so that it would give an
equal chance to all. In that case one dictionary
would do the work. How is that, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I think that is better. Let’s try that way
first, and the one who wins the game can write
the next set.”</p>

<p>“Dear, oh, me,” groaned Daniella, “then I
hope I may not guess the greatest number of
words, for I could never compose anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“I don’t believe I could, either,” admitted
Jean.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing like trying,” said Nan.
“Who shall begin, girls?”</p>

<p>“You do it, Nan. You have the pen of a
ready writer,” said Jo.</p>

<p>“I think you have the same brand of pen
yourself,” Nan declared.</p>

<p>“Never mind, you begin, and when you have
written the thing, hand it down the line.”</p>

<p>“If we had a blackboard I could write it on
that and all could see it, but failing a blackboard
there will be copies. I’ll underline the words to
be guessed.” She set to work and in a few
minutes had produced the following:</p>

<p>“The king put on his <i>abacot</i>, left his study of
<i>abiogeny</i>, and called his <i>abacist</i> from his <i>abacus</i>.
‘Calculate,’ he said, ‘how many <i>abele</i> trees it
would take to form an <i>abatis</i> one quarter of a
mile long. May I be struck with <i>ablepsy</i> if I do
not <i>absterge</i> my kingdom of those pestilent invaders
who swarm in as thickly as <i>acarids</i> on
an <i>Abraham-man’s</i> shin.’”</p>

<p>“Whewee!” cried Jo. “You certainly have
done it, Nan. I’m blest if I know one of the
words, but I’m good at guessing, and perhaps
I shall strike one or two. Hand over.”</p>

<p>Nan passed the paper along and Jo began to
scribble. “I call this an extremely intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
game,” she remarked, as she wrote the last
word. “Jack, you are a dabster. I don’t see
how you ever thought of it. I am sure it does
credit to an older and wiser head than yours.
We’ll do this often and enlarge our vocabularies.
Here’s your paper, and may you make
good use of it.”</p>

<p>Jack, much elated, took the paper and set to
work, but could guess very few of the words,
though Jean did much less well. Language was
not Jean’s strong point. No one was allowed
to examine her own paper till all were provided
with copies, and then they were given a certain
length of time for their guessing.</p>

<p>“Time’s up,” cried Nan, who had been watching
the clock.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” came sighs from all quarters.</p>

<p>“How many have you, Jo?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Seven,” was the reply, “though of course I
haven’t an idea whether they are right. I’ve
written the definitions below, as you will see.”
She handed over her paper.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” said Nan, looking over the list.
“I will allow you the six at least. Jack, what
have you to say?”</p>

<p>Jack confessed to three, though she couldn’t
be sure they were correct. She, too, handed
over her paper, and Nan went down the line to
discover that Mary Lee had guessed four, Jean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
two, and poor Daniella but one. So Jo was declared
winner and was presented with a stale
ginger cookie as a prize.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel myself worthy of this great
honor,” declared Jo, “and I trust you ladies will
agree with me when I say that I consider the
distinguished author of this delightful pastime
should be the recipient of your royal prize.
Miss Jacqueline Corner, allow me, as a committee
of one, on behalf of this enthusiastic company
here gathered, to present you with this
mark of their approval, appreciation, and esteem.”
And resting the cookie upon the fire-shovel,
she advanced with it to Jack, who, overcome
with laughter, snatched the cookie and
took a bite.</p>

<p>“A crumb! A crumb!” cried Nan. “I, too,
shared in the devising of this wonderful game.
Just one crumb, fair lady, from your feast.”
Then she fell upon Jack, the rest followed suit,
and in a few minutes not even a crumb remained
of the prize. Then dinner was announced
and all trooped out.</p>

<p>The afternoon was given over to letter writing
by many, but Jo and her cronies were seen whispering
and giggling together, and when supper
was over the result of their conference was discovered,
for first Jo appeared in a startling costume,
big hat decked off with all the ribbons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and ornaments she could collect, a remarkable
bodice, a trained skirt, long gloves, and many
chains and bracelets. She carried a red umbrella,
and though she couldn’t sing a note, she
gave a nonsensical song in a sort of recitative to
Nan’s banjo accompaniment, the refrain being:
“I was never so put out in all my life.” There
were references to the rainy day, to the little
foibles of this or that one, the incidents of their
camp life, and so on, so she easily carried off
the honors, and was called on for an encore with
such enthusiasm that she gave what was described
as “Jo’s special stunt.” She was an excellent
mimic, and her monologue won for her
peals of laughter. Mary Lee and Daniella followed
with a dance, which the Corners had
learned in Spain and which Mary Lee had taught
Daniella, who did it very well.</p>

<p>Then Jo announced: “The great event of
the evening. I bring before you the wonderful
musical prodigy, Miss Nannette Corner, aged
only eight, and already one of the world’s foremost
musicians, whose performances bring tears
to the eyes of her audience upon every occasion
of her appearance.” Then was led up tall Nan,
clad in one of Jean’s white frocks which came up
to her knees. Her hair hung down her back and
was tied with blue ribbons. She wore slippers
and short stockings, and looked, as Jack said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
“a sight.” She performed “Home Sweet
Home” upon a comb, and was presented with
a bunch of onions tied with pink ribbons.</p>

<p>“It was a great success,” every one declared.</p>

<p>“Who says a rainy day isn’t fun?” asked Jo,
as they went to their tents.</p>

<p>“It has certainly been mighty jolly,” acknowledged
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t darned a single stocking,”
said Nan.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, girl?” said Jo.
“You can darn stockings any time, but when
are we inspired as we have been to-day? Answer
me that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you believe but that I was glad
of an excuse to get out of it,” confessed Nan.
So they parted for the night, and in a little
while the only sound to be heard was the gentle
rain pattering on the leaves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>AN EARLY DIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> every morning were seen barefooted
figures scudding across the grass from the tents
to the lakeside, and next would follow a great
splashing about to the accompaniment of much
laughter.</p>

<p>Jack, who always enjoyed going further in
her discoveries than any one else, was one
morning wading just beyond where Nan was
taking her early dip. The sun had not been
up very long and there was a rosy light upon
land and water. Every blade of grass was
shining with dew and the birds were twittering
in the trees or were dipping their wings in the
lake as they flew over. Nan was appreciating
it all immensely. “There’s nothing like early
morning to give one the true loveliness of a spot
like this,” she was saying to Jo, when Jack came
splashing through the water toward her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan, Nan,” she cried, “come up here
with me; there’s a poor something caught in
the bushes, like Abraham’s ram. Do come see
what it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“What do you think it is?” asked Nan. “A
bird, an animal or what?”</p>

<p>“It’s an animal. I don’t know whether it’s
wild or not. I only saw its eyes and they were
lovely.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come, but I won’t promise to go
very near. We don’t want to be too much in
a hurry to rescue wildcats or things like that,
you know. This is properly Mary Lee’s province.
She’d march right up to the creature,
yank it out and be clawed for her pains.
Come on, Jo, let’s go see what the thing is.
Perhaps it’s your friend the porcupine, Jack.
He may have come to call on you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, porcupines don’t have big eyes like
these. This is something much bigger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it? So much the more dangerous,
I should judge. However, there’s no harm in
looking. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Just in that clump of bushes over there.”</p>

<p>The three proceeded cautiously. At their
approach the imprisoned animal struggled
wildly to free itself, and the girls stood still,
fearing lest it should suddenly become disentangled
and pounce upon them. After a few
moments the struggling ceased and they could
see only two great, soft, startled eyes peering
through the thicket. “They look to me like
the eyes of a deer,” Nan said at last. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
certainly is not a wildcat nor a fox. I tell you
what to do, Jack; go back to camp, hunt up
’Lish and tell him about it. He will know as
soon as he sees it. The poor thing is in trouble
anyway. It probably came to the lake for a
drink and has become tangled up in all those
wild grape-vines and brambles. Probably it
heard us coming and was startled so it didn’t
notice where it was going. Run on, now, Jack.
We’ll wait here till you get back.”</p>

<p>Jack was ready enough to obey and was not
long in reappearing with ’Lish. Nan and Jo
meanwhile had donned shoes and stockings and
had slipped on waterproofs while they waited
to see what would happen next.</p>

<p>’Lish, stooping and squinting and shading
his eyes from the sun, which was by now fully
risen, at last declared: “It’s a young deer for
sartin. Poor crittur, I’ll go down and git it
loose.” He approached the bushes, the girls
drawing nearer as he did so, and as he parted
the leaves they saw distinctly the graceful
head and frightened eyes of a little fawn. It
struggled madly and was almost dead with fear
when ’Lish finally lifted it out. One leg was
evidently injured in the violent struggle.</p>

<p>“Don’t let it go,” begged Jack. “It couldn’t
walk well and some beast might get it.”</p>

<p>“What ye want me to do with it?” ’Lish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
stood with the creature in his arms, making an
interesting study, Nan thought; the tall, lean,
angular man in blue shirt, and butternut trousers
with the little wide-eyed fawn looking around
apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Why, we’ll keep it till it gets well. Couldn’t
you do something to its leg, ’Lish? Rub it
or bind it up or something? Unc’ Landy
always could do things to our animals to cure
them.”</p>

<p>“Is its leg broken, do you think?” asked Nan
coming nearer the startled fawn.</p>

<p>“No, I guess it ain’t broke. I cal’late it’s
jest a little wee mite sprained. Probably it’ll
get well of its own accord, but I might rub it
with some hoss liniment I got. First-rate for
sprains. Use it myself for a lame shoulder.
Wal, come along, gals. We’ll take it up to
camp and see what <i>she</i> says. I guess I might
rig up some sort of paddock if you’re bound to
keep it.”</p>

<p>The “she” referred to being Miss Marshall,
a conference was had with that lady which
ended in a decision to keep the fawn while the
camp should be open, and then if it seemed best,
to free it. “We’ll adopt it as our mascot,”
Miss Marshall told the girls.</p>

<p>“It’ll be as tame as a kitten after while,” said
’Lish. “My brother’s wife’s sister had one, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
blamed if the crittur didn’t follow her all over
the house. It growed to be right big, horns
and all, and one day it ketched a sight of itself
in a looking-glass and blamed if it didn’t think
it was another buck and put its horns right
through the glass; smashed it all to flinders.
Susan said she would have to git rid of it after
that. She couldn’t hev no sich crittur about
the house.”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Bad luck to hev a looking-glass broke.
Didn’t ye ever hear that? Anyway, that’s
what she said, so she let the buck out and off it
went to the woods. Guess it was jest as well;
he’d soon got tired of private life, and would
have broke loose some day. They like to
range.”</p>

<p>“Was that the last she ever saw of him?”
inquired Jack much interested.</p>

<p>“No, he’d come round once in a while,
specially in cold weather, and she’d feed him.
One time he brought his mate, but that was
the last she ever saw of him. Guess he thought
after he’d brought his lady to pay her respects,
he’d done his duty.”</p>

<p>Jack laughed and followed ’Lish to the little
stable where the horses were kept and where
they housed the fawn till another place could
be provided for him. This was done in course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of time, and, as ’Lish predicted, the little creature
soon became accustomed to human beings and
learned to know his friends, would eat from their
hands, and would watch for them to come with
some special tidbit.</p>

<p>The question of a name aroused great discussion.
It was first deferred to Jack as having
the right by reason of first discovery. “I think
we might call him Dearie,” she said after a
little thought, “because, you see, he is dear
both ways.”</p>

<p>“Why not Fawny, then?” asked Jo. “He’s
so fonny, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s far-fetched and silly,” announced
Mary Lee disgustedly. “Why not call him
Caro? That’s the Spanish for dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you always want Spanish things,”
averred Jack. “If we are to give him any
foreign name I should say a German one, for
we had venison all the time we were in Munich.”</p>

<p>“What a painful suggestion,” laughed Nan.
“<i>Das Rötwild</i> is the German for deer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for that.” Jack shook her head
decidedly. “What do you think would be a
nice name, mother?” She appealed to Mrs.
Corner.</p>

<p>“How would Lightfoot do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you see one of his feet isn’t light
He can’t use it at all yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>This brought another laugh. Jack’s reasoning
was always rather unexpected.</p>

<p>“Then Tenderfoot might do,” proposed
Daniella, reminded of her ranch life.</p>

<p>“That’s worse yet!” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“We might combine Miss Marshall’s name
and Miss Lloyd’s and call him Lomar,” suggested
Miss Helen.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I once knew a boy named Jim
Lomar and I despised him.” Jack was decided
upon this point.</p>

<p>“Clearly we must be particular,” said Bertha
Stine. “Suppose we ask Miss Lloyd; she is
always fruitful of suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows we have made suggestions
enough,” said Mary Lee, “but the trouble is to
suit Jack.”</p>

<p>The question, however, was taken to Miss
Lloyd who, after a moment, said, “How would
you like Happy as a name? This is Camp Happiness,
and if he isn’t happy he ought to be.”</p>

<p>Jack considered this gravely. “Does every
one like Happy better than Dearie?” she asked
looking around.</p>

<p>“We’ll put it to vote,” said Miss Lloyd.
“All in favor of Happy will please raise their
hands. One, two, three, four—nine. I think
that is a majority, Jack, for it leaves but six to
answer. Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“Oh, yes, I believe I like it quite as well.
Probably,” she added after a moment, “I liked
Dearie better only because I thought of it myself.”</p>

<p>“A reason which influences most of us in
such matters,” said Miss Lloyd laughing, “but
few of us are so willing to acknowledge it.
Very well then, girls, our mascot is to be called
Happy.”</p>

<p>Jean took special pleasure in the little animal
though Jack always maintained she had a better
right to him, because she had been the means
of bringing him into camp. This fact, however,
gave her a feeling of responsibility which in
the end worked toward a new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“It isn’t every camp that boasts a mascot,”
said Jo at breakfast one morning a short time
after Happy had been adopted into the company.
“We must take very good care of him,
for he brings good luck, and if he gets away
we shall have to expect ill fortune.”</p>

<p>“Really, Jo?” said Jean.</p>

<p>“Why, of course. If a mascot means good
luck, no mascot means bad luck; that’s as easy
as rolling off a log.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give the child such notions, Jo,” protested
Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it isn’t a notion,” persisted Jo; “it’s
a logical sequence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Jack was also listening and she mentally
stored away the conversation and when, a
week or two later, Happy broke his bounds
and disappeared, she was weighed down by
the prospect of ill luck befalling Camp Happiness.
She had gone to the paddock as usual
just after breakfast, but no Happy put his little
soft nose between the rails to nozzle her hand
for the food she held. ’Lish was instantly
hunted up and appealed to. When had he
seen Happy? He had seen him the night before.
The paddock was then examined and
’Lish’s experienced eye detected where the
little hoofs had knocked off some bark from the
barrier which was made of cedar poles. “He’s
escaped,” ’Lish pronounced the verdict. “I
thought he was bound to sooner or later, as
soon as his leg got well.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe he’ll come back?” asked
Jack almost in tears.</p>

<p>“Ain’t likely to jest yit. He wants his run.
He may wander back some day, but he likes
his freedom same as all wild critturs. ’Tain’t
likely you’ll see him agin for some time.”</p>

<p>But Jack determined if there was a way to
bring him back it must be done, so providing
herself with some of his favorite food and a
length of rope, in her usual confident way she
started out to find the lost mascot. The print<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of his little hoofs led her through the camp,
across a field and into the first piece of woods
beyond. Here they were more difficult to follow;
only once in a while upon the damp leaves
could Jack discover the impress. One of the
pleasant occupations of the summer had been a
study of wood lore from that master woodsman,
’Lish, who knew more strange things than any
one Jack had ever seen except her old friend,
Jo Poker, in California. He had taught her
things, too. So she told herself she need not
be afraid, as she knew just how to get back.
The mountains were to the west of the camp
and the sun set behind them. The lake was to
the east, therefore when she could see one or
the other she would know exactly the direction
she should go. “When I go back,” she told
herself, “I must have the mountains on my
right for I shall be going south.” She noted
very particularly all these points as she entered
the woods.</p>

<p>She went on trying to trace the way Happy
had gone, but as he had pursued his journey
by leaps and bounds and she could only trot
along a rather difficult path, she did not make
much headway and early lost all trace of him.
Still she did not give up at once, believing she
might any time hit upon his tracks. But at
last she had to confess to herself that it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
worth while to follow up such a forlorn hope
and she resolved to go back. “It’s dreadful to
have to tell them we have lost our mascot,”
she said, “but we shall have to stand it. Perhaps
he will come back to visit us as Susan’s
deer did, and then we can think we haven’t lost
him altogether. I forgot to ask ’Lish how long
Susan had her deer before it was set free. We
have had Happy such a short time that I am
afraid he won’t come back, though I shall try
to believe he will. Now, let me see, I must
find my way out of here.”</p>

<p>She trudged on through the dense woods
which grew wilder and wilder as she continued
her way, and a rough way it was. Sometimes
she almost lost the path and sometimes it seemed
impossible that she could ever come to an opening
which would allow her to see so far as either
mountains or lake. At last, however, she did
catch a sudden glimpse of the mountains which
instead of being on the right or left were directly
ahead. “That’s queer,” said Jack stopping
short. “I’ll have to get them on my right or
my left. If I am going back they will have to
be on the right.” So she turned carefully
around but there seemed only a tangle of
brakes and bushes in that direction and no
path at all. She had not calculated upon the
twistings and turnings of the lake shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>She halted again to consider what to do, and
then bent down to examine her own footprints.
“If I were an Indian now, I’d have no trouble
at all,” she told herself. “I wish I had a dog.
Po’ old Trouble found the way to Mary Lee
and Phil that time they were lost. Let me see.
I came past that tree over there, I remember,
because I noticed that some of the leaves were
turning red.” She retraced her steps to the
tree then halted again. “Now, I can’t see the
mountains from here. I’ll try to find the lake;
it ought to be on the left as I go back.”</p>

<p>She trudged on again and finally came out
upon the shore of the lake. The spot was unfamiliar
but she was undaunted even though the
lake was in front of her instead of to the left.
“I’ve all day before me,” she said to herself, “and
if I can’t find Happy I can eat his buns, so I
shall not starve.” She examined the pretty little
shady nook she had found. “Now I know
what is the matter,” she said to herself; “the
lake turns here, because this is a sort of inlet,
only I don’t know exactly which way to go
after all.” Again she stood still and directly she
caught sight of something moving among the
trees. Could it be Happy?</p>

<p>She did not hesitate long in making her
way toward the spot where she saw the movements
and came face to face with an Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
gathering herbs. “Hallo!” cried Jack in surprise.</p>

<p>The Indian nodded. “How do?” He did
not seem in the least surprised at seeing a little
girl prowling about the woods, but went on
searching for his herbs.</p>

<p>Jack watched him for a minute, glad to have
met some one though it be a person so unresponsive.
She wanted to make conversation
but didn’t know exactly what to say. Presently
she remarked; “I’m glad you haven’t a tomahawk.”</p>

<p>The Indian raised himself from his stooping
posture. “I got,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Where? I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“In tent. You like basket? I make basket.”</p>

<p>“I like baskets. Oh, yes, you mean those
pretty sweet-grass ones? I think they are
lovely.”</p>

<p>“I make. You buy some?”</p>

<p>“If you will come to the camp I will. Maybe
the others will, too. Do you know the camp,
Miss Marshall’s camp?”</p>

<p>The Indian nodded.</p>

<p>“How far is it from here?”</p>

<p>“Three, four mile.”</p>

<p>“I must have come further out of my way
than I thought, then. Which way do you go to
get to the camp?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“So.” The Indian indicated a path directly
in the opposite direction from that which Jack
considered to be the right one.</p>

<p>“I hope he isn’t making a mistake,” she said
to herself. “I can’t tell by the sun, for it is
overhead.”</p>

<p>“I go little far with you,” said the Indian
shouldering his basket of roots and green stuff.
“My woman make basket, too. I make good
medicine. You come I show you basket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” thought Jack, “I believe he just
wants me to go to his tent or lodge, or whatever
it is, to see his baskets. I haven’t any money
and I don’t want to go further than I need.”
She turned to the Indian. “No money to-day.
You come to the camp, Miss Marshall’s camp.
Do you know ’Lish?”</p>

<p>The Indian nodded.</p>

<p>“It is the camp where he is.”</p>

<p>“I know him.”</p>

<p>“Then you come and we will buy some
baskets.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“All right. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>This was the end of the interview and Jack,
turning her back on the Indian, pursued her
way. After going a short distance she suddenly
remembered that she had forgotten to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
ask the man if he had seen anything of a tame
fawn, but concluded after all it would have
been of no use, for wherever Happy might
have been earlier in the day he would be elsewhere
now. So she walked on in the direction
she had determined upon. She had not gone a
great way before she heard a cheerful whistling
at what seemed no great distance. Following
the sound, which fortunately was coming from
in front instead of behind her, she presently
came upon a young man standing before a
sketching easel. He was busy at work upon
the canvas before him, whistling cheerily as he
worked, backing off every now and then to see
the effect of what he had done.</p>

<p>Here at least was an intelligent human being
who could set her on the right way, so she
decided to go up to him.</p>

<small>JACK HAS ADVENTURES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young man absorbed in his painting did
not see the child at first. She stood off watching
him lay on deft strokes, but saying nothing until
presently, as he backed off a little further
than usual, he almost stumbled over her.
“Hallo!” he exclaimed, looking at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” said Jack. “I
didn’t mean to get in your way.”</p>

<p>“No consequence at all,” returned the young
man. “You weren’t properly in my way, but
when I get excited over my painting I generally
prance all over the place regardless of anything
or anybody.”</p>

<p>“You’re doing a lovely picture,” remarked
Jack sociably. “I’d get excited, too, if I could
paint like that.”</p>

<p>“You would? Well, I don’t know. I’m
afraid I don’t think much of it myself. The
sun is getting too high. I ought to have
stopped an hour ago, but I was interested and
didn’t. However, I must go now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“I am afraid I interrupted you,” said Jack
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you didn’t, or if you did you did me
a good turn, for I am only doing the thing harm
by keeping on. It was better before I did this
last bit.” He began to scrape out a part of the
foreground, then prepared to pack up his painting
kit. “Anyhow, it must be near dinner time
from the looks of things,” he went on, “so I
ought to get back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, yes, I suppose it is near dinner
time,” Jack responded. “Can you tell me if I
am on the right road to Miss Marshall’s camp?”</p>

<p>“You will be if you turn right about face.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then the Indian was right after all.”</p>

<p>“The Indian? Old John? He’s a pretty
good sort. Lives in a tent back there and
makes baskets. Has some queer sort of herb
medicine he sells, a panacea for all ills; has ointments,
too. If he told you the way you could
rely upon its being right, for he knows the
place like a book. Comes up and pitches his
tent every summer, sells his baskets and
things.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen any of the girls come up
the lake?” Jack asked after a moment.</p>

<p>“I saw some going down a while ago,
toward the camp, you know. They paddle
pretty well, those girls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“My sister, Nan, paddles very well, so does
Daniella Scott.”</p>

<p>“Are you staying at the camp?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all of us are.”</p>

<p>“And you expect to get back for dinner?
Why, it’s three or four miles.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the Indian said, and I’ve gone
further since then. Well, I shall miss my dinner,
that’s all, and it will be the second time
I’ve done that lately. However, the first time
I had nothing at all to eat; this time I have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you brought your lunch along; a wise
precaution when one is off for a tramp in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“It’s only carrots and buns; not exactly a
lunch, you know.”</p>

<p>“Carrots and buns do make rather a peculiar
combination. Do you mean to say you eat the
carrots raw as one does turnips sometimes?”</p>

<p>“I never eat them at all.”</p>

<p>“Then why bring them at all? I am willing
to concede that they might satisfy an eye for
color, but I am sure I should never select them
to ease the pangs of physical hunger unless
there were nothing else.”</p>

<p>Jack laughed. “I didn’t bring them for myself.
I brought them to lure Happy with. He
is our mascot, a wild fawn that got hurt and
that we took into camp and kept. He got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
away last night and I started out to find him,
so I brought the carrots and buns for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Well, a wild fawn chase is as
bad as a wild goose chase, you know, so I
should give it up.”</p>

<p>“But if I don’t find him it will mean bad luck
to the camp, for he is our mascot.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it will bring bad luck.
Why, I had a mascot once, a fox terrier, and all
the time I had him I never sold a single picture,
and the very day after he ran away I made a
sale, so don’t you see it’s the having had a
mascot, not the having it that brings the luck.”
He spoke quite gravely, but looked up, with
a twinkle in his eyes, from where he was strapping
his easel together. Jack observed then
that he was quite good to look upon, with shining
brown eyes, a humorous mouth and a well-shaped
nose. “Are you going to eat the carrots
raw?” he asked as he straightened himself.
“I am very curious on that point.”</p>

<p>“I shall not eat them at all; I’ll just eat the
buns, although they are stale ones.”</p>

<p>“Rather a poor dinner. I wonder if I
couldn’t offer you something better. You have
a long walk before you and if you don’t mind
sharing a bachelor’s meal I’d be delighted to
share it with you.”</p>

<p>Jack was nothing if not unconventional and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the prospect of foregoing a solitary and rather
unpalatable repast was a pleasant one, so she
smiled her acquiescence.</p>

<p>“I’ve a little shack a few rods further,” the
young man told her. “My name is Marcus
Wells, Nota Bene, the boys call me. I hail
from New York, at least that is my present abode,
though I am a native of New Jersey. I am
camping out for a season of summer sketching
and just at present am lone and lorn, as my companion
has taken it into his head to go off on a
walking tour through the mountains. Therefore,
Miss——” he paused. “I beg your pardon,”
he said, flushing. “It doesn’t make any difference
about the name. You are a damsel in
distress. We will call you Carrotina Bunina,
or, if you prefer it, Diana Piccola, little Diana,
as you seem to be a huntress. How is that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Diana, please. I don’t like to be
named after vegetables.” Jack was quite
ready for all this kind of nonsense; it was
just the way Nan carried on, she thought.</p>

<p>“Well, my fair Diana,” the young man continued,
“don’t disturb me for a moment while I
run over in my mind the contents of my larder.”
He marched on silently for a few minutes, lips
pursed up and frowning brow. “Yes,” he said
after a time, “I think we can make out. Can
you cook?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“A little.”</p>

<p>“On a chafing-dish? We have one. Pinch
generally does the cooking. I call him Pinch
because he is always saying, ‘Just a pinch more
of salt or of pepper’ or whatever it may be.
He is very particular, is Pinch, and is a dabster
at cooking. If he were here we’d have some
Jim Dandy pancakes, but as it is, our menu
must be: eggs done in a chafing-dish, if you
can do them, potted ham, chicken or tongue or
sardines, canned baked beans, if you care for
them, ginger ale or coffee, crackers and cheese,
and for dessert your buns and marmalade.
Does that please the dainty palate of Lady
Diana?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s fine,” responded Jack. “I can
do the eggs. I can scramble eggs very nicely,
if you have butter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s butter and milk, too, if you
need it. Then let us his us to the lodge in the
wilderness, for in sooth I feel a craving for
sustenance, lady. This poor body of mine has
long been denied food. Yet, do not haste thee,
sweet lady, or thy feet may become entangled
in the wild waywardness of the grape which
ambushes our way.”</p>

<p>He strode on, Jack by his side, till presently
through the trees she saw a log cabin.</p>

<p>“Yonder is my poor dwelling which you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
presently honor with your fair presence,” said
the artist. He tossed down his traps upon the
ground outside, fitted a key in the lock and
flung open the door. “Enter, sweet lady,” he
cried. “Here I abide for a space. Yonder are
the rude implements of my craft; there the
poor results of my labor. Here I sleep upon
this modest couch; there I warm my weary
limbs before the open fire.”</p>

<p>“What a dear place,” exclaimed Jack, looking
around her.</p>

<p>“It is rather nice, isn’t it?” said her host
dropping his high-flown language. “I got
those old quilts from a farmhouse, and isn’t
that a jolly lot of plates? Same source. This
pitcher I picked up away back in the mountains,
real old Helmit, you see, and the plates are
Wedgewood without doubt. The quilts make
good portières, don’t you think? These rugs
an old woman in one of the mountain villages
did for me from rags she sewed herself, and the
rest of the things Pinch and I have picked up
here and there. My studio is beyond the curtain.
I’ll show you it presently. Pinch and I
built the cabin ourselves with a little local talent
to help with the practical part. This is our
third summer up here.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you love it?”</p>

<p>“I should say. Well, rather. Let us get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
something to eat and then I’ll show you
around.”</p>

<p>So in a few minutes they were merrily preparing
the meal which was set forth on an old
deal table in the most informal manner. Jack’s
scrambled eggs turned out excellently and her
buns formed a necessary adjunct to the bread
supply. She insisted upon washing the dishes
in a very housewifely way, to the great glee of
her entertainer. “Great Cæsar!” he said, “but
you are a cracker-jack at doing things. Lots
of girls couldn’t, you know, not girls as young
as you.”</p>

<p>“I’m thirteen,” returned Jack with dignity.</p>

<p>“Are you really? Well, that isn’t antique
exactly, yet you’re tall for your age, too.”</p>

<p>“Jean, my twin sister, isn’t near so tall.”</p>

<p>“Is Jean at camp, too? How many of you
are there?”</p>

<p>“We are four Corners,” laughing to see the
puzzled look. “My name is Jacqueline Corner,
then there are my sister Jean, Mary Lee and
Nan. You ought to see Nan. She talks just
that nice, funny way you do, and she is a darling.
Most people think Mary Lee prettier because
she has light hair and nice little features,
but Nan has such eyes, like stars, and she has
a face like April, so changeable; everything
she feels she shows in her face, it is so expressive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
She is seventeen, nearly eighteen, and
Mary Lee is just sixteen. Is that your violin,
and can you play? Nan plays, oh, beautifully,
on the piano.”</p>

<p>“It’s my violin, yes. Shall I give you a
tune? I nearly always play after dinner, but I
seldom care for an audience.”</p>

<p>“I should love to hear you. Won’t you
please play for me?”</p>

<p>“Very well. Suppose we make believe that
you are really the Lady Diana Piccola. I’ll
dress you for the part. Wait half a minute.”
He disappeared behind the curtain and came
out with a long green cloak, a white veil, a
scarf and some dull red draperies. “Found
these in an old garret hereabouts. Great find.
Gave a picture for them and think I got the best
of the bargain,” he announced as he wound the
red stuff around Jack’s waist, made a train of
the cloak, draped the scarf across her shoulders
and pinned the veil on her head with a queer
ornament. “There,” he exclaimed, “you look
stunning. I’d like to paint you just so. Sit
there by the fireplace and I’ll play you a
measure, fair Lady Diana.”</p>

<p>Jack took the place assigned her, and presently
the young man was watching her with
half-closed eyes as he drew his bow softly across
the strings of his violin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>It was a pretty picture, the little room, whose
walls were of chinked logs, the stone fireplace,
the wooden settle, the high-backed chair in
which sat the little lady with the sun streaming
through the open door upon the dull red brocade
of her petticoat, and touching the gleaming
ornament above her forehead.</p>

<p>“By jinks, I’d like to paint it,” said the artist,
all his soul stirred by the subject as he played a
quaint old gavotte to the child whose innocent
little face looked saintly under her veil.</p>

<p>The music was going on, rising and falling in
tender cadence when some one approached the
little cabin attracted by the strains. “Who
could be living in this queer little place?”
thought Nan who, finding that no one had seen
Jack since breakfast, started out in search of
her. She had paddled up the lake almost to
the point where the Indian’s tent was pitched.
This was as far as she and Jack had ever gone.
She had keenly scrutinized each little inlet and
cove as she went past, but, seeing no sign of
her sister, had concluded to go ashore and walk
a little way through the woods. Here she came
upon the Indian who gave her news of Jack
whom, he said, he had seen taking the path
northward along the lake. And so it was that
Jack, listening to the music and dreamily gazing
out the open door on the sunlit patches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
between the trees, suddenly sprang to her
feet.</p>

<p>“There’s Nan,” she cried, and sprang out
the door, her garments trailing after her all unheeded.</p>

<p>Astonishment of the liveliest kind was on
Nan’s face as she saw, flying from the mysterious
cabin, the figure of a mediæval princess.
Was she dreaming? Was the music a spell?
Then her countenance partially cleared as she
saw who it was. “Jacqueline Corner!” she
cried. “What under the canopy of heaven are
you up to now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan, Nan,” cried Jack excitedly, “come
in, do come in and see this darling place.
You’ll just love it.” So Nan, perfectly unconscious
of entering bachelor’s quarters, followed
her sister to where the artist, whose sense of
humor was ever present, still played the violin,
waiting to see how the situation would develop.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wells,” said Jack in her best manner,
“let me present you to my sister, Miss Nancy
Corner.”</p>

<p>The young man tucked the violin under his
arm and came forward. “Welcome to Place o’
Pines,” he said.</p>

<p>Even as Nan backed out the door her
thoughts flew to her old haunt. How strange
that the name she thought her own original invention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
should be used away up here in Maine.
“Oh, but,” she said as she hesitated upon the
sill, “we mustn’t, you know. I—oh, Jack—do
get your things and come. Mother doesn’t
know where you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan, please just stay and see the
studio,” begged Jack.</p>

<p>“Any one may visit a studio, I think,” said
the young man, his eyes on Nan’s flushed face
and troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan,” Jack went on, “Mr. Wells has
been so lovely. I went out to find Happy—I
didn’t, by the way—and I got turned around so
I was coming in this direction instead of going
toward camp. I saw an Indian.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” Nan interrupted.</p>

<p>“And did he tell you about me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that is how I happened to find you.”</p>

<p>“Well, he told me to go the other way and I
didn’t believe him, so I was coming along and
saw Mr. Wells painting and I asked him the
way. Then we got into conversation and he
invited me to dinner. I didn’t have any, you
know, except carrots and buns, and it was getting
very late.”</p>

<p>“My sister has a propensity for flights like
this,” said Nan a little more genially, as she
turned to Mr. Wells. “I am very much obliged
to you for looking after her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Oh, the pleasure was all mine,” he returned.
“We’ve been pretending, and have had a fine
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have been making believe I am a
lady in distress,” Jack informed her sister. “I
am Lady Diana Piccola. You didn’t say who
you are. You must be Sir somebody.” She
turned to her host.</p>

<p>“Sir Nota Bene, you remember,” he said with
a smile and a bow and Nan’s smile broadened.</p>

<p>“So,” Jack went on, “he dressed me up.
Don’t I look fine? And he was playing the
violin to me as you came along.”</p>

<p>“A plain unvarnished tale, Miss Corner,”
Mr. Wells asserted. “We have been playing,
and I haven’t enjoyed myself so much in a
coon’s age, as my friend Paul Woods would say.”</p>

<p>“Paul Woods? Not Dr. Paul from Virginia?”
said Nan.</p>

<p>“The same, and a dear old chap he is.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Why, if you are a friend of
his——” Nan paused.</p>

<p>“You will think better of me, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Any friend of Dr. Paul’s is a friend of ours.
He is like a brother to us and has always been
so good, to me in particular. I don’t know what
I should have done without him in Munich.”</p>

<p>“Why, bless my soul, of course. I’ve heard
him speak of the Corners dozens of times.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
How stupid of me. But one doesn’t readily associate
Munich or Virginia with Maine, does
one?”</p>

<p>“Not readily. You must let me thank you
again for being good to Jack, and—yes, I think
we might take a peep at the studio, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“I shall be charmed.” He drew aside the
curtain for them and they entered a good-sized
room with high windows toward the north. On
a large easel stood an unfinished picture.
There were queer firearms and bits of pottery
scattered about; a spinning-wheel stood in one
corner; a table littered with drawings and
books was on one side; some queer old chairs
held place elsewhere; a lot of canvases stood
against the easel and a number of sketches
were pinned on the wall. “Here’s where we
work sometimes,” Mr. Wells told them.
“Pinch goes in a little for illustration, but
I am doing outdoor work, figures once in a
while.”</p>

<p>Nan looked interestedly at the pictures.
They were delicate and tender in color yet
showed a certain vigor and sincerity. “I like
them,” she said simply.</p>

<p>“Thank you; that’s more real praise than
the exuberant gush one often gets,” the artist
responded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Nan turned and looked at him. There was
something familiar in his voice and looks.
Where had she seen him before? Suddenly it
came to her like a flash. “Why,” she exclaimed,
“we have met before. Jack, don’t you remember
the day we went up the mountain and it
rained so? We were caught in the downpour
and took refuge in that little hut.” Her eyes
grew merry with the recollection.</p>

<p>“And you saved a starving man!” cried Mr.
Wells. “Oh, yes, yes, I remember your friend
who offered the bacon and bread, but I was too
abashed to give a glance to the rest of you.
Then, you see, Miss Nancy, heaven has permitted
me to pay a part of my debt to your sister.
Would that my friend, Pinch, were here!”
He threw back his head and laughed. Nan
laughed, too. “Weren’t we a sight?” he went
on. “Those silly girls would rig up that way
to go forth into the wilderness. They’d been
staying over at Intervale, and came to this place
for a day. One was Pinch’s sister; the other a
friend of hers. Old Pinch has gone back with
them and that is why I am solus.”</p>

<p>“We were sights, too,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh, but such sensible sights, so well equipped
for a mountain climb. I felt like a very Pariah
in your midst I didn’t wonder that you fled
from us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Nan remembered why they had fled but did
not think it necessary to inform him.</p>

<p>“So you see,” continued Mr. Wells, “we are
really old acquaintances, and altogether it is
quite a heaven-arranged meeting. Don’t you
think I might call at your camp and ask your
mother to allow Miss Jack to sit for me in this
costume? I haven’t dared to mention it before,
but I am wild to do a sketch of her, and I am
sure your Dr. Paul will vouch for me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what mother will say, but it
would do no harm to ask, I think,” Nan replied
after reflection. “And now we must surely be
going. Mother will be worried. She knows
we do range off pretty much as we choose, but
this time as Jack was not with any of us she
will not be satisfied till she sees her. Thank
you for letting us see your sketches. My canoe
is just below here.”</p>

<p>So she and Jack made their adieux and were
soon paddling back to camp. “That was an
adventure, sure enough,” declared Nan as they
neared the end of the journey, “but you
mustn’t go off alone even to hunt mascots, Jack.
Something dreadful might have happened.
Suppose there had been no cabin in the woods
and you had been there alone when night
came.”</p>

<p>“But I shouldn’t have been, for after a while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
I would have discovered that I was going
wrong. I should have known it as soon as the
sun began to get over the mountains. I know
the west should be on my right when I go
south toward camp.”</p>

<p>“But all the same you might have lost your
way before dark.”</p>

<p>But Jack was not to be convinced. “At all
events,” she said, “I should have found the Indian’s
tent and his wife would have taken me
in for the night.”</p>

<p>“You don’t consider the state of mind we all
would have been in when night came,” Nan
told her.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t think of that,” Jack confessed.
“Very well, I’ll not go off alone again, and
anyhow we shall probably not have another
mascot to lose.”</p>

<small>THE BOYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Jack went to her mother to report,
Nan betook herself to the tent where she found
Mary Lee, Daniella and Jo in kimonos lying on
their cots “fooling” in a manner most girls
have. “Guess what, girls?” cried Nan poking
in her head. “Such an adventure!”</p>

<p>“Do come in and tell us about it,” responded
Jo. “Things are beginning to pall on
this crowd and we want some excitement.
What have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Did you find Jack?” asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Yes, I found her and in the finding came
the adventure.”</p>

<p>“Where did you go?”</p>

<p>“Fortunately I went up the lake instead of
down. I remembered the last time we were
out together she said we had never gone into a
certain little inlet and that she meant to explore
it some day. So I paddled up that far, got out
and discovered an Indian’s tent, one of those
basket-makers, you know. Well, you remember
how Jack always makes the acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
of any one who happens to come along, so I
thought I would inquire at the tent if she had
been that way, and learned that she had gone
along about noon, had inquired the way to our
camp, and then had taken the path leading in
the opposite direction. That decided me to follow
her track and here came the adventure. I
was going slowly along, looking this way and
that, when suddenly out of a little log house,
which I had never seen before, darted a mediæval
princess.”</p>

<p>“You don’t by any chance mean a middle-aged
lady?” inquired Jo lazily.</p>

<p>“Stupid! Don’t interrupt me at the most
exciting point of my story. Well, when I saw
this creature in dim red brocade, a green velvet
train flowing out behind her and a white veil
cascading down her back, you may imagine my
surprise, and when I saw it was Jack you can
imagine the still further surprise.”</p>

<p>“Jack!” came a chorus of astonished voices.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dears, Jack it was in the flesh,
though I wasn’t sure for a moment whether I
was dreaming or not. Oh, I forgot to tell you
that before that, I had been attracted by sounds
of a violin which issued from the little house.
Some one was playing, and playing well. It
was all like a fairy tale. Well, Jack dragged
me toward the house insisting that I should go
in and see it because it was so dear. In my innocence——”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“And curiosity,” put in Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Of course curiosity. Who wouldn’t be
curious under such circumstances? Well, I
went in and—girls, you’ll never guess whom I
saw there.”</p>

<p>“Not Miss Dolores,” Mary Lee cried.</p>

<p>“No. How could it be? You’re ’way off.”</p>

<p>“One of the girls from the Wadsworth
school, Charlotte, maybe.” This from Daniella.</p>

<p>“Not old Blue China?” Jo sat up in her
eagerness.</p>

<p>Nan shook her head. “No, no, you are not
even tepid. Guess again.”</p>

<p>“Male or female?”</p>

<p>“Male.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now this is getting interesting,” declared
Jo. “I believe it is Dr. Paul Woods.
He is always bobbing up in unexpected places.”</p>

<p>“More likely Carter Barnwell,” remarked
Mary Lee. “He spoke of coming on some
summer and living out in the open.”</p>

<p>“Wrong again, though there is a faint connection
between Jo’s guess and the reality, little
as she suspects it.”</p>

<p>“Give it up. Tell us, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Well, the proprietor of said log cabin is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
less person than the gentleman to whom you
proffered bread and bacon on that never-to-be-forgotten
occasion when we shared the mountain
hut with four much bedraggled strangers.”</p>

<p>“Nan!” Jo showed all the surprise Nan expected.</p>

<p>“True, oh, queen. I didn’t recognize him at
first nor he me, but after a while we became
vaguely conscious that we had met before. He
is an artist by the name of Wells and he’s a
perfect dear with the loveliest eyes, so full of fun
yet with a serious expression at times.”</p>

<p>“Listen to her,” cried Jo. “Nan is really
smitten.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” returned Nan hotly. “I was only
describing him to you. If you are going to
talk that way I’ll not trouble you with any
more of my story.”</p>

<p>“Now, Nancy, dear, you shouldn’t fall into
the trap so easily,” said Jo coaxingly. “I was
only trying to tease you. Go on. It is wildly
exciting.”</p>

<p>Nan, somewhat mollified, resumed her tale.
“Well, it seems that Jack came upon him in
the woods where he was sketching, and as it
was late, too late for her to walk back in time
for dinner, he asked her to have dinner with
him.”</p>

<p>“What in the world was Jack doing away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
off there?” asked Mary Lee. “Did she have
a canoe?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear. The little goose had gone
forth to hunt Happy, who, I regret to say, has
taken to the wilds again.”</p>

<p>“What a silly child. She might have known
she could never find him. Jack is getting
too big to do such things,” Mary Lee declared.</p>

<p>“Well, you know what a queer mixture of
wisdom and childishness she is, and she
thought she might be able to track him. She
insists that she did for quite a distance. At
all events, that is what she went for, and in
following the path she somehow lost her bearings
and thought she was coming toward
camp instead of going from it. The Indian
gave her the proper directions but she thought
he was trying to induce her to go to his tent
to buy baskets and she took the opposite way.
She declares it was because it was high noon
and the sun was overhead, otherwise she could
have told the east from the west. However,
there she was and had been having a royal
time. Mr. Wells had dressed her up in some
costumes he had and was playing the violin
to her, pretending she was a Lady Diana something
and he was her knight. It was the
violin which made me stop. I was listening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and wondering who could be playing it when
Jack rushed out.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you feel queer to be calling on a
young man?” inquired Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“I certainly did. I scarcely knew which
way to look at first, but when he happened to
mention Dr. Paul Woods and I found he knew
him, we got quite chummy. I only stayed
long enough to peep at his studio and for Jack
to get off her rig and then we came right back.
Oh, girls, it is the most charming little place
once you are inside. I wonder none of us
ever discovered it before. However, it is so
hidden by great pine trees you would scarcely
observe it from the lake and we never happened
to land just there.”</p>

<p>“Did you find out who the superlative
creatures were who were with him that day?”
asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Yes. At least I didn’t learn their names.
The male creature he called Pinch, and it
seems he shares the cabin with him when he
is here. One of the girls was Pinch’s sister
and the other a friend of hers. They have all
gone back to the White Mountains where they
have been spending the summer.”</p>

<p>“Peace be to their ashes. I don’t want to
see them again,” said Jo fervently. “Your
artist man is quite another thing; he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
only decent one in the bunch. Do you suppose
you will ever meet him again, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am pretty sure I shall. He
wants to have Jack sit for him in that costume
he diked her out in, and is coming to ask
mother’s permission on the strength of his acquaintance
with Dr. Paul.”</p>

<p>“How romantic! When he sees Daniella
he will probably pine to paint her; they generally
do rave over her coloring.”</p>

<p>“Now, Jo,” protested Daniella. “Only one
person ever did.”</p>

<p>“You mean only one person really ever did
paint you, but I am sure there were plenty more
who wanted to.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand his wanting to paint
Jack,” remarked Mary Lee with a sister’s lack
of admiration for one of her own family. “I
don’t think she is a bit picturesque.”</p>

<p>“You should have seen her in that costume;
she looked stunning,” declared Nan. “She is
just at an awkward age now, but Jack isn’t
going to be overlooked when she grows older.
She is such a combination of saint and sinner
that her face takes on the most varied expressions.”</p>

<p>“When’s the young man coming?” asked
Jo. “I want to be on hand when that fortuitous
moment arrives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Mercy me! I don’t know. I didn’t pin
him down to times and seasons, Jo.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is refreshing to know there is a
masculine element in the neighborhood,” remarked
Jo.</p>

<p>“By the way,” put in Mary Lee, “do you
know that our fellow campers leave next week,
and that we shall be in sole possession unless
others come? I am sure Miss Marshall would
like to have a greater number. Daniella says
that Effie Glenn and her brother would be
glad to come if Miss Marshall would consent
to making it a mixed camp.”</p>

<p>“Won’t she do it?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know; we haven’t asked. Perhaps
she wouldn’t mind if they were our
friends. There is no one but ourselves to object,
and if mother and Aunt Helen are willing,
I should think Miss Marshall and Miss Lloyd
would be, too.”</p>

<p>“One boy wouldn’t go a great way,” remarked
Jo reflectively.</p>

<p>“Still we know him and are sure he is a nice
sort,” Mary Lee went on. “If we only could
have more of our own kind we could have lots
of fun, of course.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we have more of our own
kind?” asked Nan. “Don’t you remember
that Ran and Ashby were crazy to come up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
here and were so disappointed when they found
out this was a girl’s camp?”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I haven’t a doubt but that
they’d come in a minute. Do you know just
where they are now, Nan?”</p>

<p>“I think they are still in Boston or somewhere
around there. I have an address that
will reach them.”</p>

<p>“What of Dr. Paul? Where and when does
he take his holiday?” asked Jo.</p>

<p>“He only takes two weeks and hadn’t decided
where he should go, but——”</p>

<p>“But he would be delighted to come, of
course, you sly Nan,” said Jo. “Well, my dears,
it is possible that we might get a reinforcement
of four which would mount up to five if
we include the artist, and six if his friend returns.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave out the friend, if you please,”
remarked Mary Lee. “No such disagreeable
cad for me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was only overcome with bashful
gloom,” suggested Jo.</p>

<p>The others laughed. “How descriptive!
Bashful gloom! I’ve heard of bashful smiles
and of dreadful gloom, but never such a combination,”
asserted Nan, “yet it may fit the individual.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall never have the opportunity
of finding out,” returned Mary Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“It is wrong, my dear, to harbor resentment,”
said Jo sanctimoniously.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed Mary Lee disgustedly.</p>

<p>“I think you girls would better get into your
clothes,” said Nan, “and then we can consult
mother and Aunt Helen about the boys coming
before we say anything to Miss Marshall about
it. What did Effie say, Daniella?”</p>

<p>“She said she did so wish she could have a
few weeks here with us and that she and Hartley
were tired of the seashore and did I know
of any camp for masculines in the neighborhood?
If so she and Hartley could come together
even if they stayed at different places.”</p>

<p>“Then we can certainly count on them. Let
me see, two would be cousins and two would
be friends, so there should be no objections and
it certainly would made it livelier.”</p>

<p>There was a consultation in Mrs. Corner’s
cabin and then a committee was deputized to
go to Miss Marshall, Miss Helen consenting to
head the investigating party. The upshot of
the matter was that Miss Marshall readily gave
her consent to the boys’ coming. “We often
have men in September,” she said, “when other
members of their families are already here,
though we never take in any who do not belong
in a way to those who are here. If Miss
Glenn comes, surely her brother may too, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
your cousins will, of course, be quite as acceptable.
As for Dr. Woods, though he is not
exactly a relative——”</p>

<p>“He is the next thing to it,” declared Mary
Lee, “for he is just like a brother.”</p>

<p>“And it would be very handy to have such a
good doctor in camp,” observed Jack.</p>

<p>Miss Marshall laughed. “Let us hope his
services will not be required, but we certainly
will welcome him on your recommendation.”</p>

<p>So there was a speedy sending forth of letters
and when it was announced that the camp’s
number would probably be augmented by three
or four young men it must be confessed that
those who had determined to go elsewhere
were a little regretful.</p>

<p>“You might have told us they were coming,”
said Florence Yardley.</p>

<p>“We don’t know yet that they are,” Nan told
her; “besides their coming depends on the going
of you all, you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’d be willing to give up our tent and
go in with Bertha and Carrie,” said Alice.
“Mother and Aunt Ellen could keep their
cabin.”</p>

<p>“Or Miss Marshall could put up more tents,”
said Carrie. “We would gladly stay only that
we have made all our arrangements to go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the shore and must not disappoint our friends
there.”</p>

<p>Jo gave Nan a sly look. It was like both
Carrie and Florence to be very sure their presence
would be desired. “As if we cared,” said
Jo later. “We shall have a much better time
without them, I’m sure. It will be jolly to have
just our own crowd.”</p>

<p>True to his word Mr. Wells was not long in
appearing to prefer his request and succeeded
in obtaining a reluctant consent from Mrs.
Corner after Miss Helen had promised to go
with Jack each time she should pose. The fact
that the young man was a friend of Dr. Paul
was in his favor and, moreover, he was liked
on his own account. As soon as he found out
there was a possibility of Dr. Paul’s coming to
the camp he immediately raised a protest.
“My dear lady,” he said to Mrs. Corner, “that
won’t do at all. I must have him up at the
shack, of course. I’ll write him this very night.
With Pinch away I’m consumed with loneliness.”</p>

<p>“But if Mr. Pinch returns,” said Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>A broad smile lighted up the young man’s
face. “I beg your pardon, Mrs. Corner; his
name isn’t Pinch, you know; that’s only a nickname.
He is legally known as John Sylvester
Romaine. But even if he comes back there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
room and to spare. We often put up three or
four of the boys at Place o’ Pines.”</p>

<p>“Place o’ Pines!” The name again gave
Nan a queer feeling. “Would you mind telling
me how you happened to give your place
that name?” she asked as she was walking to
the lake with this new acquaintance. Being
the eldest of the Corner girls this privilege was
tacitly accorded her.</p>

<p>“Why, your Dr. Paul suggested it. At least
he told me of a little girl he knew down there
in Virginia who named her favorite haunt that,
and used to go there to play on a make-believe
piano made of an old log.”</p>

<p>The ready color flew to Nan’s cheek. To be
sure Dr. Paul had not betrayed her name, but
he had given up her secret to this stranger, and
though long ago the place had been deserted
and was now unused and neglected, Nan could
but have a small pang and her face showed
something of what she felt.</p>

<p>The young man watched her curiously and
presently he said hesitatingly: “It couldn’t be
that you were the little girl and that I have
filched the name from you.”</p>

<p>“It was I,” responded Nan shyly.</p>

<p>“And you care. Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry. I’ll
change the name at once. It hasn’t been
called so before this summer, for I’ve never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
found exactly what I liked for it, but when Dr.
Paul told me about your Place o’ Pines the
name haunted me and——”</p>

<p>“Please keep it,” said Nan impulsively.
“There isn’t any Place o’ Pines down there
now. It is only a memory, you see. I was a
little girl, younger than Jack, when I thought of
it and made it my special haunt. I told Dr. Paul
about it and he was so interested, but——”</p>

<p>“He shouldn’t have told me, you think?
He didn’t mention names, you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there was no harm in his telling, but it
used to be such a great secret that I haven’t recovered
from the feeling that it still must be.
I’d like very much if you would name your
place after mine. I ought to feel flattered and
I do. It is like being godmother to a namesake.”</p>

<p>“How very sweetly you put it. I think you
are very generous, and if you will be sponsor it
will add still greater value to the name. It
means very much more than it did to me, and
it is our secret. Of course there is no use asking
you if you like music. I saw it the very
first day, and besides Jack told me you were a
wonderful musician.”</p>

<p>Nan gave a deprecating shrug. “Jack is
nothing if not enthusiastic and she thinks her
old Nan does wonders, but my ambitions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
far ahead of what I can accomplish. I love
music better than anything and I hope some
day to play well; I can’t acknowledge more
than that.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity there isn’t a piano in camp; we
could have some duets together, couldn’t we?
That’s one advantage I have over you; I can
carry my instrument with me and you cannot
However——” He stopped short and held out
his hand. “Auf wiedersehen! We’ll get Dr.
Paul up here and then we shall be over at your
camp every day.”</p>

<p>He pushed off in his canoe and Nan watched
him gliding up the lake. She was excited,
thrilled. It was all so romantic, so fascinating.
To meet an artist who loved music, who had
named his place after hers and with whom she
shared this secret! She stood watching the
canoe disappear around the bend and then she
went slowly back to camp, her heart beating
fast. It was like Lohengrin leaving Elsa, only
this knight would return.</p>

<p>Jo, waving a letter, met her before she had
gone far. “Open it quick, Nan. Jack thinks it
must be from Ran Gordon for it is postmarked
Boston. Do hurry and tell us if they are coming.”</p>

<p>Nan gave a sigh and reluctantly left her day-dreams.
Of what importance was a common-place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
cousin by the side of the knightly Lohengrin?
Yet she was interested enough to break
the seal of her letter and to announce that Ran
and his brother Ashby were coming the first of
the following week.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Jo. “Daniella has heard
from Effie and she’ll be here with Hartley on
Saturday. So we’re all right. Now there is
only Dr. Paul to be heard from.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wells is going to write to him to-day,”
Nan told her. “He insists that Dr. Paul shall
be his guest and in all probability he can persuade
him.”</p>

<p>“So much the better, for of course we shall
see them both more frequently. Your artist
seems a jolly good fellow and I know he will
be no end of fun when we know him better.
What do you suppose he said to me?”</p>

<p>“What?” said Nan, feeling a moment’s bitterness.</p>

<p>“He said I had saved his life and that he
would show his gratitude by giving a picnic in
my honor, when he would be the one to supply
the eatables and would I fry the bacon, please;
he liked it burnt on the edges.”</p>

<p>Nan made no answer, for a wild feeling of
jealousy completely submerged her speech.</p>

<small>PICNICKING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next week saw lively times at Camp
Happiness. Effie and her brother were the
first arrivals and at once became enthusiastic
over the camp, the lake, the mountains and the
woods. They were good friends of Daniella’s,
among the very first she had made after
entering Miss Barnes’s school, and during the
absence of the Corners in Europe, Daniella had
found the Glenns a great comfort. Effie was
a nice sensible girl of sixteen; her brother
Hartley, two or three years older, was devoted
to outdoor sports. He was an expert swimmer,
knew all about water craft and was altogether
just the sort of boy to enjoy camp life.</p>

<p>These two had scarcely settled down when
Randolph and Ashby Gordon appeared. Ran
was a little older than Hartley, Ashby a little
younger. The former already considered himself
a man, and was just at the age when girls
who wore their hair down their backs were
regarded as mere children, therefore Ran was
quite free and easy with them all, the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
especially as he and the Corners were cousins
and he had met both Jo and Daniella. Ashby
was a quiet boy, but as Nan once said of him,
“his appreciation of what others said was
worth more than some persons’ faculty for
conversation.” Dr. Paul was the last to arrive,
but went directly to Place o’ Pines with Marcus
Wells who met him at the end of the stage
route when the two took a short cut across
country, the doctor sending his luggage by
’Lish in the wagon.</p>

<p>Both young men appeared that same evening.
Nan was the first to see the lanterns bobbing
along the path by the lake. “I do believe
here they come,” she cried.</p>

<p>“What they?” asked her mother with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Why, Dr. Paul and Mr. Wells. You know
Mr. Wells went over to meet Dr. Paul this
morning.”</p>

<p>“How did you learn so much?”</p>

<p>“’Lish told me that he had brought the
doctor’s valise this far and that he had arrived
on the stage. I suppose they have come down
in the canoe, and will take the valise back
with them. They are coming directly up from
the lake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, and I suppose you are very glad
Dr. Paul has come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Of course. Aren’t you? I thought you
were so fond of him, mother.”</p>

<p>“I am, my dear, very fond of him.”</p>

<p>Nan looked a little puzzled; she did not
quite fathom what was in her mother’s mind.
Her own innocent pleasure was nothing she
cared to hide. “I’m going to get the rest and
we’ll all go meet them,” she said. “We’ll
get up a triumphal procession,” and off she
flew.</p>

<p>First she hunted up the girls. “Combs,
girls,” she cried, “two or three. Get the call-bell
from the dining-room. Run, Jack, quick.
Mary Lee, where is that little bell you bought
at the shop the other day? Get it. I am going
to see if I can borrow two or three tin pans.
We are going to meet Dr. Paul with the band
and escort him into camp.”</p>

<p>“What larks!” cried Jo. “Are they coming?”</p>

<p>“They are nearly here. We shall have to
hurry if we want to surprise them. Some of
you tell the boys and meet me here right away.”
And Nan hastened off to the kitchen to secure
the tin pans and spoons.</p>

<p>Therefore as the two visitors approached
the camp they were suddenly surprised by the
apparition of a body of young people, popping
out of the darkness, who set up a clatter of
shrilling combs, tinkling bells, and clamoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
tin pans. Nan’s wits had been equal to a
gathering of the clans.</p>

<p>“What a delightfully quiet spot,” were the
first words the party lying in ambush heard,
and Jack’s giggle was drowned in the sudden
signal Hartley gave, as heading the band, he
sprang out with an Indian war-whoop. Then
the noise began amid laughter, exclamations
and prayers to stop.</p>

<p>“You don’t appreciate the honors thrust
upon you, Dr. Paul,” cried Jo. “You are far
too modest a hero. We have come to escort
you to camp.”</p>

<p>“I am <i>not</i> the discoverer of the North Pole.
I assert that firmly and distinctly,” he began.</p>

<p>“But you have come as far north as you
could,” retorted Jo. “We don’t ask to see
your charts. We are trusting to circumstantial
evidence. See the conquering hero comes,
girls. Start it up.”</p>

<p>“But why hero?” inquired the doctor,
trying to make his voice heard above the din.</p>

<p>“Any one is a hero who is willing to trust
himself to the tender mercies of this crowd,”
explained Jo.</p>

<p>“Fall into line,” called out Nan, with a bang
on her pan. “One, two, three. Keep step,
please. Mr. Wells, you will have to go ahead
with the lantern.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“As if any one could keep step on this uneven
ground,” complained Jean who failed to
appreciate the subtlety of Nan’s joke.</p>

<p>So laughing, stumbling, making all the racket
they could, they escorted the doctor to Mrs.
Corner’s tent where he was received sensibly.
“I might have known what to expect,” he said
after the greetings were over, “though I must
say I was rather startled. That war-whoop
coming out of the darkness was most uncanny,
and gave one a creepy feeling of having really
fallen into the hands of the redskins. You were
startled, too, Marc; you needn’t deny it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not ‘denying’ it, Betsy,” he replied.
“Shall I set the lantern outside, Mrs. Corner?
Are we to come in?”</p>

<p>“We are to go over to the living-room.
There is a fine fire there,” Nan told him. “You
and mother take them over, Aunt Helen, and
present the hero properly to Miss Marshall and
Miss Lloyd, while we girls go hunt up the
feast, for of course there must be a feast. We
haven’t any, but we’ll find one.”</p>

<p>She went off leaving the young men to the
older ladies, while with the rest of the girls she
collected such odds and ends as she could. A
few peanuts, half-empty boxes of candy, crackers
in a broken state, some miserable looking
grapes were found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Let’s have everything,” demanded Nan,
“the more measly looking the better. I know
some one must have some stale cakes, or buns
or something.”</p>

<p>Jo produced some week-old doughnuts after
rummaging around for a while. Jack found
some lozenges and pop-corn left over from the
last visit to the little country shop, and this was
all that could be scared up.</p>

<p>“If we had some cheese we could make a
rarebit,” said Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we’d better not attempt one. You
remember how stringy the last was,” Jo reminded
her. “The cheese we get from the
store isn’t the proper kind for rarebits. We
could make fudge if Miss Marshall has the
things.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask,” said Nan. “This will do to
begin with.”</p>

<p>The stuff was arranged in the most elaborate
manner and carried solemnly to the living-room
where it was set grandly forth to the amusement
of those who had gathered there.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a poverty-stricken
array?” laughed Miss Lloyd. “Couldn’t you
do better than that, girls?”</p>

<p>“Why, there surely is variety enough,” said
Nan in pretended surprise, “and the things
were all very good—when they were fresh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Dr. Woods, allow me to press a few grapes
upon you; they are only a week old.”</p>

<p>“Don’t press them on him, Nan,” cried Jo.
“You might stain his nice white flannel coat.”</p>

<p>“Then I will press a lozenge on him,” said
Nan, laying one on the doctor’s sleeve and
firmly bearing her thumb down upon it.</p>

<p>“It really does put us to shame,” insisted
Miss Lloyd. “Nan, I do think we could manage
something better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Miss Lloyd, we don’t want better.
We never before had such a fine opportunity
of disposing of left-overs.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, the stuff isn’t fit to eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind; it isn’t really indigestible,
though we could make fudge or something if
you have the ingredients.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course we have. Let me see:
Chocolate, sugar, milk, butter. You shall have
them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Lloyd,” Nan responded.
“We will get to work. In the meantime, my
friends, try to restrain your eagerness for the
delicious viands set before you, and later we
will offer you something which you may prefer,
though how you can, is beyond my comprehension.”</p>

<p>The materials for the fudge were brought in
and Mary Lee, as head cook, prepared it over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the chafing-dish. It turned out to be a great
success and merriment ran high. While the
fudge was cooling Mr. Wells announced that
there would be a picnic the next day, starting
from Place o’ Pines.</p>

<p>“Have any of your party ever been to Upper
Pond?” he asked. No one had. “Then you
have a treat before you. It is simply gorgeous.
You have to canoe from here to a point a little
above our place, then we shall have to portage
across to the pond, about half a mile. The
rest of the way we go in canoes to the upper
end of the pond. I think we can manage it if
you fellows are up to carrying the canoes. Do
you ladies think you can be equal to the walk
across country?”</p>

<p>“Is it very rough walking?” asked Mrs.
Corner.</p>

<p>“Not so very. There is a pretty good path.”</p>

<p>“I think, then, if I can take it slowly, I’ll be
able to do it. I am not up to climbing heights,
but a slow walk on a level is all right.”</p>

<p>“Then you will get along nicely, for there is
no climbing at all. So, good people, you are
all bidden to the picnic. No one is to bring
any provisions. This is my show. I promised
Miss Jo I would repay her for feeding me on a
late unforgettable occasion, and she is to cook
the bacon this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Again a pang assailed Nan’s heart. Jo was
always so popular. Every one liked her. She
could be so droll and amusing, so original and
without any consciousness. She was the most
spontaneous creature, not in the least diffident,
and ready to hold her own on every occasion.
No wonder a man like Mr. Wells could appreciate
her. Jo wasn’t a bit pretty, but she had
such a merry face, such a saucy little turned up
nose. As Nan thought of this she shrank away
into a corner, all her exuberance of spirits suddenly
gone.</p>

<p>After a while Dr. Paul came over to where
she was silently watching the fudge-making and
listening to the merry sallies of wit. “This is
the jolliest thing that has happened since our
Munich days,” he said contentedly dropping
down on the big settle by her side.</p>

<p>Nan brightened a little as she always did
when any one mentioned Munich. “Those
were good days,” she returned. “Don’t you
often wish yourself back there?”</p>

<p>“I must confess that I sometimes do. I
made some good friends there whom I should
like to see again.”</p>

<p>“So did we all, I think. Do you remember
Herr Greencap, Dr. Paul?” Somehow Jo’s
affairs were in her mind overtopping all else.</p>

<p>“Yes, a bad lot, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“And you were so good about getting Jo out
of that scrape. She has never mentioned his
name since, and I don’t believe she was ever
more ashamed of herself. She has been most
particular whom she encourages, and always
consults mother or Aunt Helen when she is with
us.”</p>

<p>“That shows she is the right sort. I’d rather
a person would have a fault, acknowledge and
mend it than go blindly on in an obstinate,
colorless goody-goody way, for such seldom
admit error when temptation comes. It takes
a strong character to resist, or rather to overcome
and to acknowledge the fault.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jo would always be frank. There isn’t
the least sneakiness about her, and yes, she has
a strong character, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever hear anything about Frau
Pfeffer and her family?” asked the doctor still
remembering Munich days.</p>

<p>“That was another time you came to our
aid. Yes, we hear through Mr. Pinckney.
They are all doing well and as happy as clams
at high tide.”</p>

<p>“Your friend Miss Dolores is not married
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, but she will be in October or a
little earlier. We shall all be on hand, of
course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Do you remember a wedding we once saw
in the Frauenkirche?”</p>

<p>“Yes, wasn’t it fine? There was so much
that was fine. Oh, I would like to go back,
Dr. Paul.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall some day.”</p>

<p>“What are those two mooning about over
there?” said Mr. Wells watching Jo mark off the
squares of fudge.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are reminiscing probably. Get
Nan on the subject of Munich and she is
happy.”</p>

<p>“She has known Dr. Woods a long time, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“All her life. His father is the Corners’
family physician and they are all devoted to
both father and son.”</p>

<p>“Well, Paul is an all right fellow, straight as
a die and with a heart of gold.”</p>

<p>“Have you known him long?”</p>

<p>“We met in Europe, but saw a good deal of
one another. A friend of mine, a fellow artist,
was ill in Munich and—well, Dr. Paul pulled
him through mentally, physically and financially.
I appeared on the scene during the
convalescing period and that’s how I came to
know him so well. Poor old Crackers was
pretty well done out before Dr. Paul got hold
of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“What names you do have for one another.
Pinch and Crackers, for example. Why
Crackers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because he used to live on broken
crackers and swear he liked them better than
anything you could give him. Poor old chap!
I knew him first in Paris. He has the stuff in
him all right if he can only hold out till he gets
recognition.”</p>

<p>“Is he over there still?”</p>

<p>“Yes, working away as faithfully as his
strength will allow. He had a pretty bad
breakdown, but he is coming out all right.
Some of the boys who know of it are watching
him to see that he has a stronger diet than
crackers.”</p>

<p>“And your own recognition?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll never have any. I don’t have to
live in a garret and stir my tea with a stick of
charcoal, so I shall probably never arrive.
However, life is pretty good to me. I am not
made of such fine clay as Crackers or Dr. Paul.”</p>

<p>“That is modest of you, so you can be accredited
with at least one virtue.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t take much modesty to place myself
below such men.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love your profession?”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s ghost! Of course I do, but
that isn’t the point. The point is that I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
not make the sacrifices that either of those two
would do. I wish I dared ask your friend Miss
Nan to sit for me. Do you believe she would?
She is so picturesque.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask her?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of her. Her eyes look right into
my soul and I feel as if she would quickly discover
anything ignoble there, yet I like to
watch her face when she isn’t aware of it. I
never saw a more expressive one.”</p>

<p>“Nan is fine,” said Jo emphatically. “She
has the finest sort of standards. She is practical,
yet romantic to her finger-tips, what they
call the artistic temperament, I suppose, but it
isn’t the kind that sometimes makes perfect
fools of people.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wells laughed. “I allow that the artistic
temperament is made up in several qualities of
goods. So Miss Nan’s is of the first quality, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is. I know how loyal a friend
she can be and how she sacrifices herself
every time. She has always been a buffer
for Jack, the little sinner. But Jack will
come out all right, or I don’t know her
sister.” Then she launched forth into an account
of some of Jack’s escapades which included
Nan’s share in shielding the small sister,
while Nan, watching from her corner, little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
knew that the talk related to herself, and that
Jo’s praises were more to her advantage than a
talk with herself would have been, for so shy
was she of this new acquaintance that she was
mute before him when the two were alone. Jo
had been having it all her own way, she believed,
and she went to bed as romantically unhappy
as seventeen can be.</p>

<p>Yet she was as eager as any one to start on
the next day’s expedition, for with the morning
everything took on a rosier hue, and life was
quite worth living when one had good times
ahead in which figured the object of one’s romantic
dreams.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it the most wildly delightful way to
go?” said Jo. “Just like the voyageurs, and
isn’t Mr. Wells a perfect dear, Nan?”</p>

<p>“He is a very pleasant gentleman,” returned
Nan as coldly as possible.</p>

<p>“What an unenthusiastic person. Don’t you
like him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, well enough,” returned Nan indifferently,
though wondering if Jo noticed the
color rising to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“He is much more taken with you then,”
said Jo. Then receiving no answer, “You
are so indifferent I don’t suppose you want to
hear any of the nice things he was saying
about you last night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>If she could but know how insanely eager
she was to learn them, thought Nan, though at
the same time determining not to give an inkling
of this state of feeling. However, she
temporized by saying, “Oh, men say a lot of
things they don’t mean.”</p>

<p>“He meant these all right. He said he was
wild to ask you to sit for him, but he was afraid
of you, for you had such wonderful eyes and he
said you were so picturesque; that is more than
any one ever can say of me.”</p>

<p>Nan’s heart was beating high, her hands
were cold and her temples throbbing. They
had been talking of her and he had said that.
He was afraid of her! Oh, wonder of wonders!</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jo.</p>

<p>Nan gathered breath to say, “That was
very nice of him, I am sure, though he doesn’t
strike me as a young man who would be afraid
of any one.”</p>

<p>“That’s all you know about it.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t afraid of you; it is very apparent.”
Nan was sorry to have said this before the
words were fairly out. Jo had been so generous
in not keeping these compliments to herself
as a girl with a meaner spirit would have
done.</p>

<p>“Me? Of course nobody is ever afraid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
me. I am too roly-poly, and a nose like mine
doesn’t inspire awe.”</p>

<p>“I am sure mine is not so very much larger,
if at all,” Nan hastened to say.</p>

<p>“No, but it is a different shape. A turned
up nose is too trivial to excite reverence. Oh,
no, I am a good comrade, Nan, but I don’t believe
any man will ever really fall in love with
me.” A statement which Nan denied utterly,
and the subject of the artist was lost in the discussion
which followed.</p>

<p>Yet Nan had meat enough to feed her soul
upon that day, and trod on air as she went
forth to her canoe. Never was fairer sky nor
more placid lake, never expedition so well
planned, never romance so well begun. There
was poetry in the very noise of the paddles as
they dipped in the water; there was music in
the ripple of the waves against the canoes;
there was heaven in the thought that all day
she would be within sight and hearing of this
knight, this Lohengrin—or this Siegfried—she
was not sure which to call him. If Siegfried,
then she was Brunhilde to lose him through
unfaithfulness on his part; if Lohengrin, through
lack of faith on hers. She sat dreaming in the
canoe which Ran was paddling, and was so absorbed
that she did not hear him speak till he
sprinkled her with a few drops from the paddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“What a girl you are, Nan,” he exclaimed.
“Lost in dreams, of course.”</p>

<p>“It is so lovely,” sighed Nan, coming back
to earth.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, but it would be lovelier
if you would speak to a fellow once in a
while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” said Nan, flushing
up. “I’m very stupid, Ran. I promise not to
be such a dreamer again. What were you
saying?”</p>

<p>“I was asking if you had decided on your
college yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why no, not entirely. My certificate
will admit me to any of several, so I am considering,
and am not sure which.”</p>

<p>“You are pretty bright to be able to get in
at all at your age.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you see I am lucky in making
much of my French and German. I have had
unusual advantages in some directions, and
Aunt Helen has been such a help with English
and History of Art.”</p>

<p>“No co-ed, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not but that they have their advantages.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not go too far north, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Probably not. I think not beyond New
York, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“That’s good. So much the better chance
for seeing you sometimes. And the others?”</p>

<p>“They’ll go back to Miss Cameron’s, and
next year I hope Mary Lee will enter college.
I’m the pioneer, you see. Jo is ready to go,
but Daniella will have a long time to wait, if
she goes at all.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she stunning? I say, Nan, who could
ever recognize her in that little po’ white girl
you all found up there in the mountains?”</p>

<p>“She is very grateful that you boys don’t
seem to remember that.”</p>

<p>“We’re gentlemen, I hope, and besides she
is all right in every way and we should be
proud to be her friends. I see the canoes
ahead are turning so I suppose we are nearing
the end of the first stage of our journey.”</p>

<p>Nan looked over her shoulder to see Dr.
Paul and his friend standing on the green
shore, and the glory of her day began.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>ON UPPER POND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upper Pond</span> was truly a fairylike spot.
Slim white birches, tall oaks and towering
pines were reflected in the glassy water which
was fringed by bushes and flowering weeds,
the doubles of which looked up from the still
depths. As the paddles dipped into the quiet
surface an eagle soared away from the top of a
lofty pine tree. The water was so clear one
could see the smooth pebbles and shining sand
at the bottom of the pond, and as the canoes
glided along, they and their occupants were
mirrored below.</p>

<p>The party was variously divided; Nan, to
her joy, found herself in the same canoe as
Marcus Wells, and watched him skilfully paddling
in advance of the rest. “It reminds me
of the gondolas on the Grand Canal,” she said
presently.</p>

<p>“You’ve been to Venice then. Isn’t it
great?”</p>

<p>“It is wonderful, though this is as much so
in its way. Paddling a canoe must be something
like rowing a gondola.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Something, but I’d make an awkward figure
as a gondolier.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever try it? Ever so many Americans
do.”</p>

<p>“I did, but though I managed to make the
thing go, I knew the good Antonio was secretly
amused, for I am sure I was as stiff as a
ramrod, just as all are who are not born to it.”</p>

<p>Nan had her own ideas about this, but she
did not contradict the young man. In her
opinion he was grace itself, and she doubted if
ever any gondolier surpassed him.</p>

<p>It was not a very long distance to the spot
which Mr. Wells had chosen for their landing
and here the hamper was set ashore. It had
been something of a tug to get things over,
but all had given a willing hand and so it was
managed, yet all decided that it was none too
soon to begin preparations for the lunch, as
every one was tired and hungry. There was a
small fireplace already built, showing that the
spot was no new discovery.</p>

<p>“We are going to have some fish,” Mr. Wells
told them as he threw out some rods and lines.
“I’ll show whoever cares to go fishing, where
he or she can get plenty of trout. Then some
one must gather wood and some can open the
cans and set the table. Here’s the table.” He
indicated a large flat rock a convenient distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
from the fire. “To Miss Jo is given the high
office of chief bacon fryer, and whoever will
can undertake the coffee. Now you know what
is to be done, please pitch in.”</p>

<p>The Gordon boys and Hartley Glenn voted
for fishing, Nan offered to make the coffee,
Mrs. Corner and Miss Helen opened the
hamper, Mr. Wells started the fire, while the
rest gathered wood and set the table, all but
Jo who clung to her package of bacon and the
frying-pan.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells was a most efficient host. He was
everywhere, helping this one, joking with that,
lugging water from a near-by spring, replenishing
the fire. The fishermen, though a little
dubious when they started off, were not a great
while in returning with the fish which were set
to cook on the flat stones heated for the purpose.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have believed we’d be so lucky
in so short a time,” said Hartley. “This is a
great place, Wells. Your discovery?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I suppose some hundreds of
years ago the Indians made it a favorite camping
ground for we find traces of them now and
then, but I confess to have come upon it unawares
one day when I was off prospecting for
suitable subjects to paint. I haven’t written
the place up, nor have I gone so far as to sound
its praise too widely, so pray be cautious how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
you let the public in on the ground floor as it
were, or I’ll have to get the owner to put a
fence around it.”</p>

<p>“Then there is an owner?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an old fellow who owns some acres of
wild land of which this is a part. Are we
ready? I am sure those fish are done, don’t
you think so, Mrs. Corner? Try this one.”
He deftly lifted the fish from the hot stone and
offered it to Mrs. Corner on a bit of birch bark,
a pile of which he had prepared to be used
as plates. “Some salt in that hamper, Miss
Jo?”</p>

<p>Jo managed to find it. Then the coffee was
rescued from the smoking fire, but only after
the handle of the coffee-pot had dropped off.
The tin cups, which all carried hanging from
their belts, were filled, the remaining fish were
dished up on the birch-bark plates and every
one was served.</p>

<p>“I never tasted anything more delicious,”
declared Miss Helen. “This is a feast for the
gods.”</p>

<p>“And in a banquet hall to match,” said Nan,
“a very Walhalla.”</p>

<p>“Good name, Miss Nan,” cried their host.
“Walhalla it shall be from henceforth, for we
are in a castle rock-bound and in the clouds.”
He pointed to the craggy heights surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the little pond which lay like an iridescent
jewel in the midst of the green.</p>

<p>The hamper showed a surprising array of
food for the locality and as each article was
passed around some one would exclaim, “Why,
where did you get this?” Blueberry pies,
doughnuts, spice cakes, crackers, cheese, homemade
bread and butter, jams and jellies, olives,
and as a crowning dish, chicken salad.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” cried Jo. “What a provider
you are. How you managed to compass
all this I can’t see.”</p>

<p>“How they managed to lug it all over here
is what I can’t see,” said Miss Helen.</p>

<p>“We took turns, you know, and it was not
so very heavy when we had put a pole through
the handles of the hamper,” said Ran.</p>

<p>“But where did you get fresh pies and fresh
bread?” asked Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you into the secret, which after all
isn’t much of one. I have a good friend in
my neighbor, Mrs. White, who, when given
sufficient notice, can get me up almost anything.
The salad I must confess to having been a
little dubious about, but among the supplies
Pinch and I had sent from Portland was a can
of olive oil and I made the dressing myself, if
you must know.” Mr. Wells was really a
little abashed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Good boy!” cried Dr. Paul. “It takes an
artist to do a thing up brown. You didn’t
live four years in Paris for nothing, Marc.”</p>

<p>Mary Lee, with housewifely care, insisted
that the remains of the feast should be packed
away for future use and then while the older
ladies rested under the shade of the trees, the
younger ones declared for exploring the surroundings.
They broke up into separate
parties which went in different directions to
meet later for the trip home.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells tossed his sketching kit into his
canoe and looked a little hesitatingly at Nan.
“I wonder if you’d care to go to the head of
the pond,” he said. “A little way up a small
stream that I know of it is very lovely.” Now
was his chance to get a sketch of the girl who,
in her big hat, short skirt, white jumper, with
red handkerchief knotted around her throat,
looked picturesque enough.</p>

<p>But when the opportunity was within her
grasp Nan was shy. She turned to her mother.
“Don’t you want me to read to you, mother?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, no, dear, not if you would like to go.
I’m sure Mr. Wells will take good care of you
and it isn’t far.”</p>

<p>“No, quite near,” Mr. Wells assured her,
more eager because of the apparent reluctance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
“It is just up there a little way. You could
see the spot from here but for the foliage.”</p>

<p>Nan turned to Dr. Paul, who was waiting,
too, for her decision. “What are you going
to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t quite made up my mind.
Mary Lee, Miss Jo, Miss Daniella and Miss
Glenn have gone off with Hartley and the Gordon
boys, so if you go with Marc, I shall probably
devote myself to the twins. No one ever
lacks entertainment where Jack is.”</p>

<p>This decided Nan. Dr. Paul would see to it
that the twins were not neglected, and brought
face to face with the choice of going with the
doctor instead of the artist she found she could
not withstand the temptation of the latter’s invitation.
She had not shown herself eager and
that was a satisfaction. So she stepped into the
canoe and they pushed off. The canoe moved
up the pond and was presently lost to sight in
the bending branches of green which hid the
mouth of the little stream where the fishermen
had found their trout.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the others had gone off in an
opposite direction, to explore the further side of
the pond and, if possible, to climb a giant rock
upon whose top was the tall pine tree from
which the eagle had flown. Eagle Rock they
had dubbed this and found the climb to its top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
a difficult one, though equipped as they were,
and with the help of the boys, the four girls
managed to scale the height to find themselves
overlooking farm lands in the valley beyond,
and further away the Presidential range of the
White Mountains towering above the lower
peaks.</p>

<p>“It was worth coming for,” declared Daniella
with glowing face, “though it was a hard
climb.”</p>

<p>“We ought to have had alpenstocks,” said
Hartley.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with cutting some now?”
said Ran. “We’ll really need them more going
down than coming up. There are plenty of
saplings about.” He drew his knife from his
pocket and began to hack away at one of the
slim, straight, young trees close by.</p>

<p>Hartley followed suit, but the loose stones
upon the sloping side of the spot where he was
standing made a precarious footing, and in his
exertions the stones gave way causing his knife
to slip and give him an ugly gash across his
left hand, nearly severing one of his finger-tips.</p>

<p>Jo was the first to perceive the accident and
she ran to Hartley’s side. He was bleeding
profusely. Jo whipped off the tin cup hanging
from her belt. “Here,” she called out sharply.
“Somebody get some water, quick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>Daniella grabbed the cup and rushed off.
There was a small trickling stream near by to
which she hurried. Effie, meantime, had come
up and turned sick and faint at the sight of the
blood covering her brother’s hand. “Oh,
Hartley,” she quavered, “is it very bad?”</p>

<p>“He has about cut off the end of one of his
fingers, that’s all,” said Jo. “Don’t faint, Effie,”
she added commandingly, seeing Effie turn as
white as a sheet. “Hartley has to be attended
to; we can’t hold you up, too.” She had already
clapped the end of the finger back in
place and had wrapped her handkerchief around
it to stop the bleeding. Presently Daniella
came hurrying back with the water with which
Jo carefully washed the wound, then diving into
her pocket she drew forth a small case. “Can
you stand a few stitches?” she asked Hartley.
“We haven’t any plaster, you see, and it may
save you further trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stand it,” said Hartley grimly, though
he winced and set his teeth when Jo, after threading
her needle, took several stitches in the severed
flesh.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “you stood it like a soldier.
A clean handkerchief, if any one has it. Mine is
about used up. I hope you don’t mind my
tearing it,” she said as Effie produced hers.</p>

<p>“As if Hartley’s comfort wasn’t worth a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
handkerchiefs,” replied Effie who had recovered
her composure.</p>

<p>Jo made a neat bandage, sewed it firmly on
and pronounced the operation over.</p>

<p>“That’s perfectly great,” declared Hartley.
“Jo, you are a first-class surgeon. I don’t believe
any one could beat that job. I am your
eternal debtor.”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t all right, Dr. Paul can make it so,”
Jo told him. “Fortunately we have a doctor at
hand. I don’t suppose mine is skilled labor at
all, but it will serve till something better can be
done. It will hurt like the mischief for a while,
I suppose, and perhaps we had best get back to
the doctor.”</p>

<p>“No one need ever say again that Jo isn’t
expert with her needle,” said Mary Lee admiringly.
“How did you ever happen to have a
needle and thread with you? You of all persons
who never sew until you are obliged and
compelled to.”</p>

<p>“Why, it was sheer luck. Aunt Kit made
me the little housewife and stuck it in the
pocket of this skirt; she gave me the skirt, you
know, and insisted that it should have a pocket.
Well, the little case has stayed just where she
put it, for I never bothered to take it out, and
fortunately I remembered it at the right moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“If it hadn’t been for your quick wits as well
as for your skill very probably I should have
lost the top of my finger,” said Hartley gratefully.</p>

<p>There was no more cutting of alpenstocks in
this particular spot, but eventually each one of
the girls was provided with one and one was
cut for Hartley. The Gordon boys, being familiar
with steep mountains in their own part
of the country, declared they could do without
them. Before they reached the foot of the rock
Jo was invested with the title of “First Aid to
the Injured” given with due ceremony. She
was made to kneel down upon the grass; the
other girls crossed their alpenstocks over her
head while Ran tapped her on the shoulder
with a pretended sword. “Rise, Lady
Knightess,” he said, and Jo arose amid acclamations
and congratulations. The title proving
too heavy a one it was shortened to “Aid”
before they reached the end of their walk, and
this was a favorite nickname from henceforth.</p>

<p>They found Dr. Paul had just returned from
taking the twins around the pond and the patient
was brought to him. He examined the
hurt carefully. “First-rate,” he gave his opinion.
“I don’t believe I could have done better
myself. Miss Jo, you ought to study medicine,
or trained nursing, at least.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Oh, dear me,” returned Jo, “what would
little Josie do while she was waiting for practice?
She couldn’t live on stale pills, and if she
devoured the sample bottles of tonic sent her
she’d be all the hungrier for real food.”</p>

<p>“But you’d make such a famous trained
nurse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I never did like striped gowns, and
I can’t bear the smell of ether.”</p>

<p>“You’d get used to it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Very well, if I call upon you for
a recommendation I shall expect you to forward
it promptly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll certainly do it,” responded the doctor
heartily. “Such ability oughtn’t to be wasted.
That is a very neat piece of work. If the wound
was well washed I don’t think you will have
any trouble with it, Hartley, for it was evidently
a clean cut. We’ll stop at our place on the way
home and I’ll give you something to ease it a
little.” The finger was bound up again and the
bandage neatly sewed on, Jo’s needle and thread
again being called for, while every one agreed
that such a little housewife as hers should be a
necessary part of every camping outfit.</p>

<p>“That’ll be work for the next rainy day,”
said Miss Helen.</p>

<p>“Then we must all make a journey to the
country store for materials,” said Mary Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Good! It’ll be a fine excuse for going,”
said Daniella. “We can all make a shopping
trip to-morrow if nothing happens.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nan and her cavalier were ensconced
in the quietest of nooks not far away.
Here the stream narrowed so one could touch
the trunks of the trees arching overhead. Wild
little creatures rustled among the leaves on the
ground, bounding away as the canoe softly
crept up the small waterway. The birds, so
wild as to have little fear, swung in the branches
above or, with slanting wing, skimmed the surface
of the water. One could see in the clear
stream a wary fish suddenly darting away, and
once a wild goose, paddling up-stream, arose
with a cry and plunged into the deep forest.
Except for the sounds of the woodland creatures
the place was so still one could hear the
fall of a leaf on the ripples below.</p>

<p>“Are you going to sketch?” asked Nan as
her companion laid his box on the grass.</p>

<p>“If you will sit for me.”</p>

<p>“I? With all this loveliness about us?”</p>

<p>“It is lovely, but it isn’t paintable, that is to
say, not very, and I haven’t dared to ask you
before to sit.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You seem to stay in a world
of thought sometimes where I can’t find you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
only I know you are there by a look in your
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Nan did not know what to say to
this. She was not used to talk of this kind.</p>

<p>“And will you give me a sitting? I won’t
keep you very long. Just sit there in the prow
of the boat and I’ll get out my colors in a jiffy.
There, like that, and will you take off your hat?
Thank you. That’s great. Just what I’ve been
longing for.”</p>

<p>Nan sat very quietly in a sort of dream.
Once in a while her companion made a remark,
but he was absorbed in his sketch and did not
talk connectedly. It was enough for Nan that
he was there, that she was alone in this romantic
spot with this creature of genius. Oh,
it was wonderful! The water rippled softly
about the keel of the boat, the sky was blue
overhead. Yonder was Walhalla. She was
listening to the “Waldweben.” Her thoughts
were indistinct, her emotions were not acute
nor violent. She was in a dream. A gentle
and serene content possessed her. She was
satisfied to sit so always in this entrancing spot.</p>

<p>The absolute quiet was broken by Mr. Wells’
rising. “There,” he said, “I’m not going to
martyrize you any longer. Thank you a thousand
times, Miss Nan. This doesn’t begin to
do you justice, but I’ve caught certain characteristics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
I think.” He turned the sketch so
Nan could see it. If she was a little disappointed
she did not say so, but only remarked,
“I don’t see how you did so much in such a
short time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, one can do a mere sketch in a few minutes,
sometimes. Please don’t consider this a
finished thing.”</p>

<p>Nan could see it was not, and comforted herself
by thinking it would have been much better
if there had been more time.</p>

<p>“Now what can I do to repay you for your
goodness?” said the young man. “You are
a wonderfully patient sitter. You scarcely
stirred.”</p>

<p>“I am glad if I did sit still. It was all so
lovely that I enjoyed just thinking about it.
Did you bring your violin to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. You see, I don’t play for
every one.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t mind playing for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. You belong to the chosen few,
only we must not have an audience. What are
you going to do to-morrow afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I have planned.”</p>

<p>“Then I will meet you about half-way between
Camp Happiness and Place o’ Pines.
You come in your canoe; I’ll come in mine.
We will go ashore and I will play for you.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Then with a sudden smile, “Or, I’ll meet you
more than half-way. I’ll come to the little point
just opposite Three Rocks. You know it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“And will you come about four o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I will ask mother whether I ought.”</p>

<p>He smiled again. What a little girl it was.
There was never a time when Mabel Romaine
would have hesitated. “I’ll ask her myself,”
he said with sudden decision. “Shall we go
now?”</p>

<p>“I think we should,” said Nan sedately.
And if she made no more than monosyllabic
replies to his remarks on the way back it was
not for lack of interest in them or of delight in
his company.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wells</span> proved abundantly able to plead
his cause before Mrs. Corner who finally gave
her consent to Nan’s presence at a private
violin performance. “Though why we can’t
all be favored, I can’t see,” said Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>“Well, you see there are very few people I
can play before,” confessed the young man.</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, dear lady. I suppose it’s because
I’m made that way. Now, I have no end
of cheek when it comes to my pictures. They
may be mere daubs, but I don’t think so, and
am perfectly brazen about sending them to exhibitions
or about showing them to any one,
but the violin, ah, that is different. I can play
before Miss Nan, Jack, Pinch, Dr. Paul and a
few others and there you are. I am bound to
break down if I get it into my head that I have
a critical person in the audience. Whether
there is such a person or not, doesn’t appear to
matter; it’s my thinking there is. I can’t help
it, you see.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Corner said at last, “even if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
can’t see any reason for your extreme modesty
in the matter I’ll have to believe it exists and
am willing Nan should have the pleasure I
know it will be to her to listen to your playing.”</p>

<p>Therefore when all the others started off to
the country store, Nan declined to go. She
had begged her mother not to tell of the engagement
she had made, partly because she
did not want to be teased and partly because it
was too sweet a secret to share with any one
but her mother. Mrs. Corner guessed the
former reason, but did not suspect the latter.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going with us?” asked Dr.
Paul who appeared early in the afternoon. “I
thought we were all going to buy out the dry-goods
department of Mr. Davis’s store.”</p>

<p>“No, I am not going.” Nan shook her head.
“I have something else to do, but I will delegate
you to buy the materials for my housewife.
In compensation thereof I will make
you one.”</p>

<p>“Now, what ought I to say? That the compensation
is ample? If I do that it will mean
I prefer the housewife to your society; on the
other hand, I ought to prove my appreciation
of such a souvenir as a piece of your handiwork.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let the housewife have the compliment,”
returned Nan laughing. “I can do without it.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
She watched him go off to join the others
and then went to the empty living-room to pass
away the time, till four o’clock, by writing a
letter to Charlotte Loring. She looked frequently
at the clock and the letter did not turn
out to be a very long or a very interesting one,
being disjointed and rather vague, yet Nan
concluded to send it. Then she went to her
tent to get ready. She was not given to prinking,
being less afflicted with vanity than Mary
Lee, who was generally considered the beauty of
the family, yet she took a long time to decide
upon her dress. Should she go in the blue
flannel skirt and blouse she generally wore, or
should she wear a skirt and white jumper as she
had at the picnic? At first she thought she
would wear the latter because Mr. Wells had
chosen to paint her in this costume, but finally
she decided that this being a special occasion, she
would wear a white linen, only a simple frock,
to be sure, with low sailor collar. The only
color she added was a soft yellow silk tie which
Jo had once told her was very becoming. She
did her hair carefully, braiding the thick plaits
smoothly and tying them with the black ribbon
she always wore. Let big red or blue bows be
for such youngsters as Jack or Jean. For a
moment she thought of doing her hair up
higher, but she had never worn it so and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
would be marked. So at last she was ready
and started out, being careful that the canoe
was very clean that she might not soil her dress.
She did not want to be late, but she hoped she
was not too much ahead of time.</p>

<p>Her watch pointed to four when she landed
her canoe at the little point which was but a very
short distance above the camp. No other
canoe was there, so she was first after all.
Well, at all events, she had the virtue of
promptness which the other had not.</p>

<p>Yet she had not long to wait for in a few
minutes she saw a canoe coming. So Elsa
had watched Lohengrin approach in the swan
boat. Her heart thrilled at sight of the figure,
like Lohengrin in white, standing there paddling
the canoe. It was almost as if she were
at the opera watching the scene, her imagination
supplying the music. Very soon her
Lohengrin was within hailing distance and saw
her there, a white figure against the lush green.</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are,” he cried. “I’m afraid
I am a trifle late. I was hunting up some
violin strings and couldn’t remember where I
had put the things, but I have them all right.”
He came ashore and held out his hand. “Isn’t
this jolly?” he said. “Such an afternoon,
enough to inspire any one. Do you happen
to sing, by the way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“I have only a feeble pipe,” replied Nan
smiling.</p>

<p>“Your voice and laugh sound as if you
would sing a good contralto. Perhaps your
pipe, as you call it, needs only developing.
Shall we try it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no.” Nan shrank from such an
ordeal and her tones evinced such fright that
her companion laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, then we won’t,” he said. “I say, you
look stunning. I dressed for the occasion, too,
as you see. These are my very best flannels
and I hope you think the red tie is becoming.”</p>

<p>Nan thought it was vastly so, but she could
only echo feebly, “Very becoming.”</p>

<p>“Yours is tremendously so, an awfully jolly
bit of color.” He stood off and looked her up
and down with half-closed eyes in the impersonal
way that artists have. “I like you in
white,” he continued. “That’s a good scheme
of color, too, green, white, yellow, with a dash
of dark hair for a sharp accent Pretty nice
that. Well, there is to be no boring you with
posing to-day. What shall I play?” He took
his violin from its case and began to tune it.</p>

<p>“Mein liebe schwan?” said Nan questioningly.</p>

<p>“Good! Somehow suits the landscape,
doesn’t it, the lake and all? Here goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>He stood up while Nan took her place under
a tree on a grass-hidden rock, to listen, and in
a moment her soul was filled with delight. The
swan song, and here was Lohengrin! Little
thrills of delicious joy seemed to ooze out of her
very finger-tips as she leaned back against the
tree to hear. The swan song melted into
“Elsa’s Dream,” and then into the “Höchtes
Vertrauen.” The young man played well, his
head thrown back as he watched his hearer from
under his lashes. He saw the color come and
go, the frequent trembling of her lips, the far-away
look in her eyes. “My, what a lot of
temperament the girl has,” he said to himself.
“It is worth a king’s ransom to be like that.”</p>

<p>He put down his violin. “What’ll you take
for your gift of appreciation, Miss Nan?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Nan came back from the clouds. “It isn’t
for sale,” she answered. “But why do you
want mine? Haven’t you enough for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, but I’d like to hand yours over
to some person who hasn’t any.”</p>

<p>“And leave me with none?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you have such a lot. You could
spare half and then have more than the common
run of mortals.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“You show it.”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> fond of music, you know.”</p>

<p>“I should say so; that’s why I can make this
speak for you.” He patted his violin. “You
enjoy Lohengrin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I love it, though perhaps not more
than other operas of Wagner’s, only it was the
first I ever heard of them, there in Munich,
and—oh, dear——”</p>

<p>She broke off with a sigh.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only there was such joy in being
able to hear delicious music any time and all
the time.”</p>

<p>“I want tremendously to hear you play. You
will play for me some time, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Nan trembled with delight. What did this
not suggest? Future meetings after this summer
dream was over? “Of course I will,” she
responded, “if we should ever happen to be
together where there is a piano.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall be. You don’t suppose I shall
let you all fade out of sight after all these good
times together? You are in New York sometimes,
aren’t you? I think I have heard you
speak of having friends there.”</p>

<p>“We have some very dear friends, and we
generally stop on our way up or down to see
them. If you ever talked to Mary Lee you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
would have been sure to hear her speak of Miss
Dolores Pinckney. She is Mary Lee’s idol and
is to be married in the fall. We are to be her
bridesmaids.”</p>

<p>“Then you will be walking in to this.” He
tucked his violin under his chin and began the
Bridal Chorus. “I hope it will remind you of
this special occasion,” he said as he paused.
“You must say to yourself: The last time I
heard that was when that renegade artist played
it for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are not a renegade, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I am or not. What
is a renegade anyhow?”</p>

<p>Nan thought for a moment. “Some one
who is false to his cause, his principles, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“That is about it, I should suppose. What
are my principles, then, my cause?”</p>

<p>“Your profession, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I am true to my art. I want to
be. I am feeling the way as yet, however.
When I get to the place where I am sure of
what is true to me in art, I hope I shall stick to
that. At present I seem to be in the fix of that
fellow in the Bible—who was it that asked what
is truth?”</p>

<p>“Pilate, I believe.”</p>

<p>The young man stood thoughtfully playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
little snatches on his violin, only a few notes of
a motif or some simple melody. Presently he
broke into a wild Hungarian dance. “Let’s be
gay, be gay,” he said. “We mustn’t spend
time in moralizing. We must live, live. Here
we are, you and I, young and happy. The
world is beautiful, the sky is blue. There is
poetry everywhere. Listen.” A few crashing
chords closed the dance and he began softly to
play the motif of the “Waldweben” watching
Nan who leaned forward, her chin in her hand,
her eyes fixed on the further shore. As the
last notes of the bird song died away he
lowered his violin. “Well, Brunhilde,” he said,
“awaken!”</p>

<p>Nan smiled. “I was there, in the woods.
How did you know?”</p>

<p>“I guessed as much. You see I have been
playing on your emotions and you look quite
pale. Have you had enough of my performance?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, only I am sure you have had, and
I must go back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother, what for? The day is still
fairly young. Stay and talk to me a while.”</p>

<p>Nan hesitated. “I think we’d better go
back. We can talk there.”</p>

<p>“Where is everybody?”</p>

<p>“Gone to Davis’s store to buy materials for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
housewives. Each of us has sworn to have one
always on hand since Hartley’s accident.”</p>

<p>“Good scheme. Will you make me one?”</p>

<p>“I?” She hesitated. She had already
promised one to Dr. Paul, but she must not let
a chance to serve her Lohengrin pass her by.
“Oh, yes,” she answered, “I’ll make you one,
if you like.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t a difficult task.”</p>

<p>“Not very. We are going to do them on
the first rainy day, but I don’t have to wait for
that. I really think I should go back now; I
promised mother I would not stay very long.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go, too. We can use one canoe
and tow the other one. I’ll hand you back safe
and sound to your mother, and tell her you
have been an inspiration.”</p>

<p>Nan colored under this. “But I haven’t,”
she protested.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you have. Any one who loves
music as you do is a boon to one who enjoys
it, too. Do you love anything else as much?”</p>

<p>“No, not quite, although I do love pictures,
and some poetry, some authors, too.”</p>

<p>“Of course. You would, you know. I could
see you loved pictures that first day in the
studio, for you had a nice discriminating sense
and criticized like a person who really knows
what is what.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“Oh, but did I criticize?” Nan was quite
overwhelmed at the idea of her daring.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean you found fault, but you said
such things as showed you knew what you were
talking about, and were not talking just for
effect.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Helen taught me about pictures as we
went through Europe, and so I suppose that is
why I have a little sense about them,” said Nan
modestly.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is just it. Because you have seen
the best under a wise teacher you can tell. It
is the same with poetry, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Aunt Helen has guided me there,
too, though I always loved to pore over the old
poets in my father’s library.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wells nodded with approving smiles.
“I wonder why people nowadays are ashamed
to confess to loving poetry. As to quoting it,
almost any one will smile if you begin to do
that, yet in the old days, not so very old ones
either, it was quite an accomplishment. Once
in a while, in secluded spots, you will run across
some old fellow who will quote Moore and
Byron with his hand on his heart.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Martin Boyd, down in Virginia, still
does that. He is a gentleman of the old school,
and his gallantries are so funny, still I always
thought them delightful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“I’ve not a doubt but that they are, though
I can easily see how he couldn’t help being gallant
in the presence of certain persons.”</p>

<p>Nan had no reply to make to this, and feeling
very conscious, she turned to where the
canoes were moored. On the way Mr. Wells
stopped to gather a bunch of yellow buttercups.
“These will just match your tie,” he said to her
as he handed them over. “Isn’t it strange that
they should be blossoming in September?”</p>

<p>“I have noticed that the flowers don’t keep
track of the season up here,” she answered, putting
the buttercups in her belt with a resolve to
treasure them and press them when the day
was done.</p>

<p>“Tell me about your home,” said Mr. Wells
as they were gliding along over the lake, and
Nan described the old brown house, the rambling
garden, the hillside where Place o’ Pines
used to be, the ruined walls of Uplands, the
sunset tree where she had met her Aunt Helen,
the mountain forests and all the rest of it.
Launched upon this theme she forgot to be
conscious and her descriptions were vivid and
picturesque.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells listened interestedly. “I think I’ll
have to accept Dr. Paul’s invitation to go down
there some day,” he said. “Are you there all
the time except in summer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“No, we’ve been very little there of late
years. Aunt Sarah keeps the house open, and
we go between while, generally at Christmas,
and sometimes at Easter. We were abroad
for a year. Last winter we were at school in
Washington, and this year I go to college.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do? And where?”</p>

<p>“To Barnard, I think.” Nan made the decision
suddenly. Was it not in New York?</p>

<p>“That’s good; then no doubt but I shall see
you often. Will all the family be there, too, in
New York?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure what the others will do.
Mother and Aunt Helen hate to make so many
changes in the schools and very likely I shall
have my freshman year without them. Then
Mary Lee will come along, I hope, and later
the twins.”</p>

<p>“But even if they are not there you can come
and have tea at the studio. Pinch and I have
one together, you know, and his sister or some
of our friends help at the tea-table.”</p>

<p>“That would be delightful.” Nan spoke
with less enthusiasm, the chill of a stranger
presence touching her.</p>

<p>“You know you will need your friends to
rally around you if you are to be there alone,”
continued her companion.</p>

<p>“So long as our dear friends, the Pinckneys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
are near at hand I shall not mind, and no doubt
I can do very well anyhow, for we were one year
at boarding school while mother and Aunt
Helen were in Europe. Then, two of my old
chums will be with me. Jo Keyes is one, you
know.”</p>

<p>“And a mighty jolly little somebody she is.
She must come with you to the studio. We
must plan it all out before you leave camp.”</p>

<p>He turned his attention to steering the canoe,
and in a short time they had reached the landing.
The shoppers had not yet returned, and
Mr. Wells decided to wait for Dr. Paul that
he might not have to walk back to Place o’
Pines. Nan with a demure wisdom, not usually
shown by so young a girl, led the way to the
porch where her aunt and mother sat, so there
was no more opportunity for a tête-à-tête that day.</p>

<p>After a while the shopping party came back,
a merry crowd, each carrying a bag of peanuts,
and laden with other purchases. They all made
a great display of their dry-goods, pretending
to squabble over the assumed preëminence
of one purchase above another.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will say mine is the very
prettiest,” contended Dr. Paul unrolling a gay
piece of cretonne.</p>

<p>“It’s entirely too ornate,” Hartley spoke up.
“Just look at those colors, Miss Nan. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
this subdued gray is in much better taste and
is more suitable. I leave it to our artist friend,
there.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t to be compared with my reliable old
blue,” declared Ran, producing his length of
linen. “I consider I have made the hit of the
season. Just look at the quality, Nan.”</p>

<p>Nan laughingly examined first one then another,
but was wise enough not to commit herself
to any preference. “Did you think of getting
flannel for the leaves?” she asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Yes, and ribbon to tie up the things, elastic
for the pockets, assorted needles, thread, black
and white, and a spool of silk. Dr. Paul, show
Nan your stores. He even has two celluloid
thimbles; the one for himself is bright red.”</p>

<p>“So easy to find,” explained the doctor. “See
how well it fits.” He stuck it on his finger.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” exclaimed Hartley, “don’t do that.
It reminds me of my late accident.”</p>

<p>“Yours is blue,” the doctor told Nan. “I
hope it fits as well as mine does. Try it on.”</p>

<p>Nan obeyed and announced that it would do
very well.</p>

<p>“I believe we bought out the entire stock of
thimbles,” said Jo. “Nan, it was as good as a
show to see Mr. and Mrs. Davis. I don’t believe
they ever had seen such a crowd of customers
at one time in the store. Mr. Davis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
was like a pea on a hot griddle, and once or
twice looked so wild I thought he would take
to flight, but his wife always came to the rescue
with ‘They’re on the top shelf, Al,’ or, ‘I’ll git
’em, jest you keep still.’”</p>

<p>Nan laughed. Jo’s imitation of the vernacular
was perfect.</p>

<p>“When are you going to make my housewife?”
asked the doctor.</p>

<p>Nan gave a swift glance at Mr. Wells. “The
first rainy day,” she answered, though she resolved
that there should be moments in between
when she would secretly find time for
the other one. This she decided should be of
fair white linen like her dress, and she would
embroider yellow buttercups upon it. It should
be tied with yellow ribbons and the little leaves
for the needles should be worked around with
yellow silk. What a joy it would be to make
it. She could steal off to the woods to do the
work and it would be a charming task.</p>

<p>The visitors did not stay to supper, for there
was no moon to guide them on their way and
Mr. Wells had brought no lantern, but they
lingered till the last moment, and as the artist
bade Nan good-bye he gave her hand a slight
pressure. “You won’t forget,” he said softly.</p>

<p>How could she forget anything of that wonderful
afternoon when the gods had arrived?</p>

<small>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> do you think?” cried Jean one
morning as she came from the big cabin to
find Nan drowsily swinging in a hammock
under a big butternut tree. “We’re going to
have a birthday party, a double one. Day
after to-morrow is Dr. Paul’s birthday and it’s
Jo’s, too, so we’re going to get up some sort of
funny stunts, have a feast, and in the evening a
straw ride.”</p>

<p>Nan roused herself. “What kind of stunts?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, almost anything. We are going to
dress up in costume, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“Where do we get costumes, pray?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll manage. ’Lish is going to take
us all over in the wagon to Davis’s store and
we’ll see what we can find.”</p>

<p>“I think that will be fun,” said Nan. She
loved this sort of thing.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come over where we all
were?” asked Jean. “They told me to go
find you and tell you about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“How could I know what they were talking
about?” returned Nan, getting out of the hammock
and making her way to where the group
had gathered on the porch.</p>

<p>“Come on, Nan; we missed you,” cried Daniella.
“We’re having a lovely time. Where
were you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just over there in the hammock.”</p>

<p>“Dreaming as usual, I suppose,” said Mary
Lee. “I believe Nan is training to be a poetess;
she spends so much time flocking by herself in
wooded nooks and shady dells.”</p>

<p>“All the flocking by yourself in the world
wouldn’t make you poetical, Mary Lee,” retorted
Nan. “What’s up, girls? Give us the
programme.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing definite has been arranged.
We thought it would be fun to dress up in the
evening and have a little dance. Miss Marshall
says we may, and for that evening, as long as
it is a double birthday, we needn’t have the
lights out till ten. We’re all going over to the
store to see what we can rake up.” Effie gave
this information.</p>

<p>“I’ve about decided upon my costume,” Jo
announced suddenly, “if I can manage to get it
together in time. One day isn’t very much
notice.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have two days, counting the birthday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
for the thing won’t come off till evening,” said
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Well, I think maybe I can
manage it if—but never mind, we mustn’t tell,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I know what I shall do,” exclaimed Jack.
“I wish Mr. Wells would hurry and come.”</p>

<p>“I think he’ll be along pretty soon,” Dr. Paul
told her. “If he had known that such an exciting
plan was to be talked of he would have
come with me.”</p>

<p>It was evident from Jack’s speech that she
meant to consult the artist about her costume.
“I can’t decide till I see him,” she said further.</p>

<p>“Come here, Jean,” Nan called. “I have
thought of something for you.” She whispered
her suggestion to Jean who nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“You might tell me,” urged Jack coaxingly.</p>

<p>“No. Can’t do it. Everything is a secret
now.” Jean shook her head.</p>

<p>“We have to buy birthday gifts, too,” said
Daniella, “but the price is limited. I’ll tell you,
Nan, what amount we have decided upon.”</p>

<p>“This is very embarrassing, Miss Jo,” said
Dr. Paul. “Suppose we retire to the seat under
the tree.” And they beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>“We’re going to spend only ten cents apiece
on the presents,” Mary Lee told her sister, “like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
we did for the Christmas gifts in Munich. It
will be fun to buy trash and make much of it.”</p>

<p>“And the costumes can’t be very elaborate,
of course,” Effie said. “We shall have to make
them up out of such materials as we can find.”</p>

<p>Nan knew what she would like to wear, but
was not sure that she could manage it. She
was so deft with her fingers, so ingenious that
she knew she could invent something, given
any sort of chance.</p>

<p>“Here they come back again, and Mr. Wells
is with them,” announced Jack, who was on the
watch.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Ashby. “Now we boys
can get some ideas. I have not a notion what
to wear. I always was a duffer about such
things.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” cried Mr. Wells coming
up. “Great doings, I hear. Let me into the
scheme, please.”</p>

<p>“It’s a dress-up party in honor of Dr. Paul
and Jo Keyes, whose birthdays occur on the
same day,” Mary Lee told him. “We are
planning a celebration.”</p>

<p>“And we’re looking to you as an artist to
help us fellows out,” Ran told him.</p>

<p>“All right. I’m your man. I have a few
togs here, so you can take your pick. You are
welcome to anything I have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Oh, and——” Jack looked disappointed.
“I wanted you to help me,” she whispered, going
up to him.</p>

<p>“And I’ll be delighted to help you,” he returned.
“Come over here and let’s talk it
over.” He led her to one side and she made
her request in low tones.</p>

<p>He nodded acquiescence. “Of course. I
owe you much more than so small a favor in
return for sitting so patiently for me.” So as
usual Jack got out of her dilemma in the easiest
way possible.</p>

<p>Presently the wagon came rattling up. ’Lish
looked over the number doubtfully. “Ye ain’t
all goin’ to ride, be ye?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It does make a pretty big load,” acknowledged
Mary Lee, always concerned for the
horses. “Suppose some of us walk over and
ride back; the rest can ride over and walk
back.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to fix it,” said Hartley.
“I’m agreeable either way.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we men all walk both ways and
give the ladies the wagon,” proposed Ran.</p>

<p>“Oh, you old Virginian,” cried Mr. Wells,
“isn’t that just like you? Suppose some of
the ladies would rather walk one way?”</p>

<p>“I would, I’m sure,” declared Jo.</p>

<p>“And I,” Daniella spoke up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Jean wasn’t sure. Jack thought it depended
upon the company she would have. Effie
would do as the rest did. Nan was for walking
over, Mary Lee for walking back. So the
party divided and the wagon started off with
Mary Lee, Jean, Jo and Effie for the feminine
side; Dr. Paul and Ashby for the masculine.</p>

<p>Therefore to Nan’s joy she found herself setting
out with Mr. Wells, Hartley escorting
Daniella and Ran giving himself up to Jack
who generally followed Nan’s lead. The wagon
bumped on ahead and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>The three mile walk, though a rough one,
was generally shady, and those had the best of
it who took a time of day which would not give
them the sun immediately overhead. The
wagon, of course, had reached the little shop
before the walking party arrived, and already
the counters were strewn with various stuffs.
Mary Lee was buying yards of white cheese
cloth, Jo was examining red flannel, Effie was
looking at thin white muslin, while the two men
of the party consulted together in low tones on
the porch. Jean was on the lookout for Nan
who had suggested her costume.</p>

<p>It was a bewildering time for Al Davis who
told his chums afterward that he “didn’t know
as he’d have a mite of stawk left on his shelves
after they got through.” Every box of gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and silver paint was called for, ribbons were in
demand and all sorts of impossible things were
inquired for. Jo ended by asking for all the
old newspapers he had. She wanted a quantity,
and a pile of them was put in the wagon.
Nan had already demanded pasteboard and
not being able to secure sheets of this called for
as large boxes of pasteboard as could be
found.</p>

<p>Jo and Dr. Paul were hustled out of the shop
while the gifts were selected; this took so long
that the two kept coming back and demanding
that a stop be put to purchases. “I don’t propose
setting up a shop for myself,” said Dr.
Paul. “You all seem to be buying out the
establishment. Mr. Davis will think we are
going to start a rival concern.”</p>

<p>Al laughed, and “cal’lated” he wasn’t
“scairt”; he “ruther guessed he’d be there
some time yet.”</p>

<p>At last all came out, each clutching a parcel,
and the start back was made, though Mr. Wells
gave up his place to Jean who complained of
the sun, and so to Nan fell Ran’s companionship
on the way back. She forced herself to
be gay although it was bitter to see Mr. Wells
walk off with Jo when she had counted on his
society. She could have shaken Jean for her
little affectation of not being able to stand the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
sun. “Jean always was a self-indulgent little
piece,” she told herself. “There was room
enough, anyway. I don’t see why he couldn’t
have come. I didn’t dare make a point of it.”</p>

<p>All this while Ran was saying, “I say, Nan,
this is jolly. Somehow I don’t see as much of
you as I expected; you are always off somewhere
with one of those older fellows. I suppose
you are too grown-up to want to go
around with anything under twenty-one. Girls
always are grown up before boys, but never
mind, I’ll get there.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense, Ran,” said Nan. “Of
course age has nothing to do with it. We all
roam around together. Nobody selects one in
particular.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me there is a mighty good deal of
twosing,” returned Ran.</p>

<p>“Have you chosen your costume?” asked
Nan willing to change the subject.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Wells wants us to come up
this afternoon while you girls are at work on
your things; then we can decide better.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will be able to make suggestions,”
returned Nan. “With a twist or two
of a bit of stuff he can make a thing look just
right, and he has no end of odds and ends he
keeps in an old chest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t doubt but we shall do,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Ran not any too well pleased to hear praise of
the artist.</p>

<p>As was generally the case, more than her
share fell to Nan’s lot. Her own dress turned
out to be more intricate than she had expected,
then there was Jean’s to see to. Moreover Jo
got into a muddle over hers and came to Nan
in despair to help her out, but by turning over
the sewing of Jean’s to her mother, Nan managed
to get all done, though it kept her busy
every minute, yet she felt the result was worth
the effort.</p>

<p>There was a great skirmishing about and
running from one tent to the other after supper.
Many shrieks of: “Don’t come in!” many
suppressed giggles but at last all were ready
to troop to the big cabin where Dr. Paul, who
had arrived early, waited with Jo. The former
was magnificent as a Roman senator in toga
and laurel wreath while the latter was as saucy
a Mother Goose as could be imagined, in towering
hat, red cloak, red shoes with high heels,
and under her arm a marvelous goose made of
Canton flannel and stuffed with the newspapers
gathered from the store. These had not proved
nearly enough, so all sorts of things supplemented
them, pine-needles, moss, excelsior,
anything that could be gathered up. It was
in the manufacture of the goose that Jo’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
powers had failed, and when she called upon
Nan for help, and it was Nan who stuffed and
pinched and set a stitch here, gave a punch
there till a goose of respectable proportions at
last was triumphantly completed.</p>

<p>Bearing their gifts, the donors met on the
porch. The older ladies had begged to be
freed from any part in the procession, though
Nan had made a Quakeress of her mother and
a Martha Washington of her Aunt Helen, these
costumes requiring but little trouble. With
Miss Marshall and Miss Lloyd these constituted
the audience, the chaperons, the girls called
them.</p>

<p>There was much whispering, giggling and
comment outside before the procession was
ready to move. “We must have some sort of
system about it,” said Mary Lee, “and not
straggle in anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Siegfried!” breathed Nan as Mr. Wells,
with his fur rugs draped over his shoulders,
and a horn slung in place, came up to her.</p>

<p>“Brunhilde!” he exclaimed at sight of her
helmet, shield and the coat of mail manufactured
principally of silver paint. “You are
wonderful. I don’t see how you managed.”
He looked her up and down admiringly.</p>

<p>“Did you guess I would be Brunhilde?”
she asked shyly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“Not I. Did you guess I would be Siegfried?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a coincidence? We must march
in together.”</p>

<p>“You tallest ones go in first,” suggested
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>So to the glad call of the “Son of the
Woods” Brunhilde and Siegfried stepped off
followed by Daniella as a cow-girl with rough
shirt, big felt hat and pistols in her belt, Hartley
as King of Hearts being her escort. Over
his dress of white, on which red hearts were
pasted, he wore a long red cloak, ermine-edged,
and on his head a pasteboard crown.
Mary Lee in Greek dress came next with Ran
as a gondolier, then Effie as a Puritan Priscilla
and Ashby as a Pierrot. The twins
brought up the rear, Jack in the dress she had
worn when sitting for the picture and Jean as
a Brownie, her eyes opened very wide and her
mouth stretched in a set smile. A peaked cap
with cape covered her head and shoulders, and
her body was clothed with the same brown stuff.</p>

<p>Nan had an idea in the presentation and improvised
a jingle which she started up to the
tune of the song in Der Freischütz when the
maidens sing to Agathe before her wedding
wreath is put on. Each girl bobbed a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
curtsey as the foolish gifts were presented.
Gewgaws of the most ornate kind they were.
A huge ring with glass setting for Dr. Paul
matched by a brooch of similar style for Jo.
Handkerchiefs of giddy colors and coarse texture,
framed pictures, hideously inartistic, and
boxes of cheap confectionery. A laugh followed
the opening of each gift, and they were
displayed in the most obvious manner.</p>

<p>“There’s only one sensible thing in the
whole lot,” announced Jo holding up a pink
pincushion bearing the words: “Many happy
returns” done with pins. This had been Jean’s
patient task and she was highly pleased when
Jo said: “If there’s one thing I never have
when I want it, that thing is a pin.”</p>

<p>Then came the supper, a special feast set out
on the big table.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful cake!” remarked Jo,
viewing a large iced affair in the centre.</p>

<p>“It had to be big for a double birthday,”
Jean said. “I hope it is as good as it looks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is bound to be,” returned Jo with
cheerful optimism.</p>

<p>“You must cut it,” said Dr. Paul, when the
time came, and he handed her a knife.</p>

<p>With a great flourish Jo lifted her knife and
brought it down on the iced surface. It did not
penetrate an inch. She pressed on harder; still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
dense resistance. “This is the hardest icing I
ever saw,” she remarked. Then she began
scraping away the icing, beginning to suspect
a joke which she discovered in the large tin pan
underneath, which had been simply turned upside
down and iced over.</p>

<p>“Now who is the perpetrator of that?” inquired
one and another, but not one could, or
would, tell, so to this day it remains a mystery.
Though if one could have seen ’Lish and Hetty
looking in the window, stuffing their handkerchiefs
in their mouths to stifle their chuckles as
they tried to catch a glimpse of Miss Lloyd’s
impassive face, it might have been suspected
that the joke originated in the kitchen. However
it made for much laughter and there was
a real birthday cake, if a smaller one. In this
was found a ring, a thimble and a coin. To
Daniella fell the ring, to Mary Lee the thimble
while Mr. Wells secured the coin.</p>

<p>The straw ride had been postponed until the
next evening as it was seen that there would
not be time for this and a dance, too, if they
were to linger at all over the supper.</p>

<p>“If there is anything I hate to do it is to hurry
away from a good feast,” Jean had remarked
when the programme was being arranged.</p>

<p>“And if there is anything I hate it is to lose
any part of a dance,” said Mary Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“Then why crowd all into one evening?”
asked one of the boys.</p>

<p>“No reason at all for it,” said Jo. “We may
as well string it out and have two jollifications
instead of one, I say.”</p>

<p>All agreed to this, hence they could tarry at
table as long as they wished.</p>

<p>Nan had been so busy over her costume that
she had not thought much about outside arrangements.
“I don’t see how we are going
to have a dance without music,” she said to
Jack who was sitting next her.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you know?” answered Jack.
“Didn’t you see the big box ’Lish brought this
afternoon? There’s the music.” She turned her
sister’s head around and Nan saw standing on
a table in the corner a phonograph on which
Hartley was already placing a record.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” exclaimed Nan. “Who
thought of that?”</p>

<p>“Ran and Hartley. They went over to
Friendship, waylaid Noey Peakes, got him to
send a telegram to Portland, for the phonograph,
and he brought it over on the stage, then ’Lish
went for it.”</p>

<p>“What a nice thoughtful thing to do,” Nan
expressed her approval. “Of course, Ran,” she
answered her cousin who stood asking for the
first dance, and if she saw Mr. Wells turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
away with a frown she may have felt a slight
pang, though after all she told herself that Ran
deserved the dance if he wanted it.</p>

<p>“False Brunhilde,” said Mr. Wells to her a
little later. “Didn’t you know that first dance
was mine by all rights?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied she. “Ran asked first.”</p>

<p>“But I took it for granted. We were paired
off in the procession, so—of course.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t take everything for granted,”
returned Nan shaking her head. “Suppose I
had taken it for granted and you had not, I
might have been a wall-flower.”</p>

<p>“You’d never be that,” he returned; “you
dance too well. This is mine, anyhow,” and he
guided her off in a two-step.</p>

<p>It was the happiest of evenings to more than
Nan, for after everything had become quiet, Jo
found a chance to gather her friends around
her. “There was never such a birthday for
any Mother Goose,” she said. “All the good
times in my life I owe to you dear people, and
if I never have any more, I shall at least have
the memory of those which no one can rob me
of.” And considering that Jo was usually a
thoughtless person, as well as one little given
to sentimentality, it showed that she was much
moved.</p>

<small>BEFORE THE STRAW RIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> straw ride did not come off the next
evening, after all, for there were signs of rain,
then it was decided to wait for a moonlight
night when they could go to a small village
where ’Lish informed them they could get ice-cream
that was “lickin’ good,” so with such a
prospect in view they all concluded it was worth
while to wait. In the meantime there was
plenty to occupy them, both during the day
and in the evening. Generally the whole party
would congregate on the porch after breakfast
where they would “train” as ’Lish called it,
till some one would say: “I’m going out on
the lake.” This would be the signal for a
“scatteration.” Some would take to the canoes,
others to the woods. Those more indolently
or quietly disposed would either remain
where they were or, with a book, would
seek a hammock under one of the great
trees. In the afternoon there was usually a
gathering at Place o’ Pines where a cup of tea
could always be looked for, the girls taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
their turns in serving. Miss Helen and Mrs.
Corner enjoyed this outing, as indeed they did
many of the others. Dr. Paul and Mr. Wells
always returned to camp with the party, staying
to supper and returning when the time
came for lights to be out.</p>

<p>During this time Nan took more than one
opportunity to steal off by herself that she
might work secretly upon the little sewing case
she was making. That for Dr. Paul had been
the work of the first rainy day when all sat
around the open fire industriously sewing.
Mary Lee had fashioned a like case for Ran,
Daniella had made a fac-simile of her own for
Hartley, being assisted by Mrs. Corner, for
Daniella had not had much experience in such
things and needed instruction. She was, however,
so careful to obey directions, and was always
so anxious to do her best, that she really
did not turn out a bad piece of work. Effie
had been persuaded by Ashby to try her powers
on a case for him, so there was work
enough for all hands, and for more than one
rainy day.</p>

<p>Jo, though expert enough in sewing up
wounded fingers, declared she could not do
fancy work, and indeed the little case she attempted
for Miss Helen was such a funny-looking,
clumsy affair that every one laughed at it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
except Miss Helen herself, who insisted upon
keeping it, saying it was quite in character with
the rough clothes she wore at camp.</p>

<p>It was one morning when all the rest had
taken themselves off canoeing that Nan stole
away to the woods for a quiet hour. She carried
a book and her work, and sought a certain
shady nook where the pine-needles made a soft
carpet, and a plantation of ferns, a short distance
off, was a pleasant thing for the eye to
rest upon. A trickling stream wound its way
between weedy banks, and in one specially
clear and still pool the birds delighted to take
a daily dip. It was a charming spot, and one
which Nan had come upon suddenly one day
when looking for mushrooms. She had been
attracted by some curious and brilliantly colored
fungi growing beyond the open field where
she was, and had penetrated the thicket to discover
the pool, the ferns, and all the rest. On
this particular morning she had hardly seated
herself when she heard a rustling in the pathway
which she had worn from the open to her
nook, and looking up she saw Dr. Paul.</p>

<p>“Caught you,” he exclaimed. “Aren’t you
a sly little somebody to steal off this way and
never give an inkling of where you were going?
If I hadn’t seen your yellow kerchief in
the distance and followed its beckoning flame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
I might have searched in vain through these
pathless woods.”</p>

<p>“And have been a pathless Woods yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, call that off. We’ve been
having jokes all summer about dense woods
and gloomy woods, though I must confess this
is the first time pathless has been served up.
What were you going to do? Read?”</p>

<p>“Well, I did bring a book.” Nan was too
honest to actually declare this to be her main
intention, though she did make use of the subterfuge.</p>

<p>“I brought one, too.” He put his hand in
his pocket. “Suppose I read while you work.
I see you have that pretty feminine thing, a
sewing-bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe I care to work,” Nan
answered with a little regret for her unfinished
buttercups, “but I should enjoy hearing you
read, and in being lazy. What is your book?”</p>

<p>“Oh, something I picked up from Marc’s
shelves. I haven’t really looked at it.” He
turned the pages over. “Oh, I say, it’s Italian.
I only saw the title and didn’t realize that the
Dante was in the original. Stupid of me not
to open it.”</p>

<p>“He reads Italian then?” Nan was pleased
to make this an excuse for talking of her hero.</p>

<p>“Or else picked up the book because he liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
the binding. Marc is like that, you know.
The utilitarian doesn’t specially appeal to him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is the way with most artists.
They like interesting things whether they use
them or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, I believe. They are a queer lot.
There was Marc’s friend over in Europe starving
himself for the sake of an idea. He was a queer
study, that fellow, yet one couldn’t help respecting
him for his absolute heroism in devoting
himself to the thing he most cared for.”</p>

<p>“That is the one they call Crackers, on whose
account the angels will lay aside another trailing
feather for your wings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense. I didn’t do anything of any
account. Any decent doctor would have done
the same for one of his countrymen. We won’t
dilate upon that subject, Nan.” The doctor was
really confused.</p>

<p>“Such funny names, Crackers and Pinch!”
continued Nan, her thoughts still on the subject
of Mr. Wells and his friends. “What sort of
man is this Mr. Romaine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not altogether a bad sort. Does a little
illustrating in a dilettante way, has a wealthy
dad, you know, and has a studio in New York
all gorgeous with Eastern things and armor
and so on. Marc and he have it together.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“By the way, Pinch is coming back next week,
and I believe his sister and Miss Kitty Vanderver
are coming, too. The ladies are going to
stay at the White farm, and then they will all go
home together when Place o’ Pines is closed.”</p>

<p>Nan felt as if a cold hand had suddenly
clutched her. With these would come farewell
to the happy little reunions, to the walks and
talks, to the moments when she found herself
by the side of her artist friend. “And you will
be going, too,” she said ruefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, my holiday is nearly over and it has
been a royal one, though I must say, Nan, I
haven’t seen as much of you as I expected.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Ran was complaining of a few
days ago,” Nan told him. Just because she
was the eldest, the most grown up, why should
they want to monopolize her? “You see,” she
went on, “we generally are all in a bunch together,
and there isn’t any seeing of any one in
particular.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is,” replied the doctor with
meaning.</p>

<p>Nan flushed. There were times, she well
knew, when she had stolen off as she had done
this morning, and there had been other times
when the violin had been played to her alone,
but with quick wit she turned the tables on the
doctor. “Do you know,” she began, “that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
summer I have been hoarding up a grievance
against you?”</p>

<p>“You have?” The doctor looked genuinely
surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes. What business had you lightly to
give away my confidence?”</p>

<p>“My dear Nan,” the young man looked distressed,
“what do you mean? When did I ever
do such an iniquitous thing?”</p>

<p>“When you told Mr. Wells about little Nan
Corner and her Place o’ Pines.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked overwhelmed with remorse.
“I am in dust and ashes,” he said.
“I acknowledge my offense. It has been on
my conscience all summer, but I thought you
seemed quite satisfied, and I was relieved that
you didn’t resent it. I suppose I told it at some
time when I was waxing enthusiastic over my
friends at home, over you, Nan—I do that once
in a while—and one of the entertaining tales I
told to show how original you are was about
your music and Place o’ Pines. I never dreamed
Marc would notice the name, or, if he did, that
he would use it, or using it, that you would
ever hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand. Can’t you think up
a few more excuses?” Nan inquired, rather
enjoying the situation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I could, if those are not enough. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
really never gave a thought to the possibility of
the thing’s coming out as it did, but it was
pretty mean of me to shout abroad your little
secret, that you had told me in confidence. I
ought to have known you would treasure it,
even when you grew older. Indeed, Nan, I’m
awfully sorry. I will get Marc to change the
name if you say so. He will do it in a moment
if he thinks you care.”</p>

<p>Nan did care, but not in the way the doctor
supposed.</p>

<p>“Marc may have his faults, but they are not
those that would make him stiff over a matter
of this kind,” the doctor went on.</p>

<p>Faults? Was not Lohengrin a perfect
knight? But feeling that Dr. Paul had been
sufficiently punished, Nan said, with an appearance
of generosity, “Oh, I really don’t mind,
Dr. Paul, not in the least. Mr. Wells discovered
that I was the originator of the name and
I gave him permission to use it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that puts another face on the matter.
Why didn’t you tell me in the beginning, you
little tease?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought you deserved some slight
punishment. Now you have had it we will
drop the subject. Where did you leave the
others and what have you been doing this
morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“I came straight here as soon as I reasonably
could. I saw all the canoes out on the lake
when I came away from the studio. I left
Marc putting the finishing touches to the study
he made of Jack. He had a sudden fit of industry
this morning, consequent, I think, upon
his hearing that Pinch is about to return.”</p>

<p>“Then laziness is one of the faults you
referred to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I shouldn’t say that. I
never saw a fellow work harder when he is in
the humor; on the other hand when he loafs he
does it quite as enthusiastically, which is probably
the right way. He will paint all day,
very likely.”</p>

<p>“Is Jack sitting for him?”</p>

<p>“No. He thinks he will not work any more
on the figure, but is doing the interior. He is
putting in some still life and things.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he paints well?”</p>

<p>“I think he is best in landscape. What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“I think that, too. I think he needs to study
figure more, and besides I believe he has more
feeling for out-of-doors than for indoors.”</p>

<p>“That is about the correct criticism, I should
think, though I don’t profess to know as much
as you do about such things. What have you
decided about college, Nan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“I think, taking all things into consideration,
that Barnard will be the best.”</p>

<p>“I am glad it is no further away, though I
did hope you would go no further than Baltimore.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Helen and mother think it will be
pleasant for me to be near the Pinckneys. You
know Mercedes is coming on to the wedding,
and they are begging all of us to spend the
winter in New York.”</p>

<p>“And will the others?”</p>

<p>“No, the girls must go back to Miss Cameron’s,
mother says, and she can stay in Washington
all winter, for it will not be quite so hard
a climate. We are hoping Mary Lee will be
ready for college next year, so I shall have her.”</p>

<p>“I hope then that she will be ready. You
think you will like the college?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Aunt Helen approves of it, and,
when I can go, I shall have a chance to hear
good music which I can do better in New York
than anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I can understand that such opportunities
as New York affords for music would
be a great factor in your decision. What about
Miss Jo?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know exactly. She is trying for
some tutoring. If she gets it she will enter
Barnard with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“She is a bright little body. I never knew
any one more capable.”</p>

<p>“We all think that, and isn’t she the very
best sort of companion? If she goes to Barnard
it will be a very strong reason for my
going, too. If ever I get in the dumps Jo will
be there to pull me out. She can so much more
easily find stepping-stones in New York than
elsewhere that I think she is pretty sure to
enter with me. Charlotte Loring is at Barnard,
too, and that is another thing in its favor. I
was rather surprised she didn’t choose Radcliffe
or Wellesley, but she said she thought it
would be better for her development to go
further from home, and Charlotte is nothing if
not conscientious. She’d live on nails and wear
dried peas in her shoes if she thought it better
for her development. She and Jo hope to room
together as they used to do at the Wadsworth
school, so I shall have to have a strange roommate
or be by myself. I think perhaps I’d
rather room alone.”</p>

<p>“And after college, what? More travel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I am not looking so far
ahead. One never can tell.”</p>

<p>“Those were good old days in Munich, but I
am afraid we shall never repeat them.”</p>

<p>“If we could have it all over just the same,
I’d like it, but Aunt Helen says I couldn’t, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
there is always something different when one
tries to repeat experiences. For one thing you
wouldn’t be there, Dr. Paul, and that would
make a heap of difference.”</p>

<p>“Would it, Nan? I’m glad of that. It
would make a great difference to me if I returned
and you were not there, just as it will
make a great difference to all of us when you
come back to the old Virginia home.”</p>

<p>“The dear old home and the dear old friends!
I often long for them. One does like the friends
around that one has had a good time with,”
said Nan in a matter-of-fact way. “I shall enjoy
college much more with Jo and Charley
there, but I shall miss Mary Lee and Dan.”</p>

<p>“Does Daniella aspire to college?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so. She could not be ready
for some years, and then she would be older
than most girls who enter. Still, if she sets her
heart on going Mr. Scott will allow it. Aunt
Helen advises travel and languages with a
course of literature, rather than college, so no
doubt she will abide by what her friends and
teachers suggest. She is the most humble
child in such matters, though as proud as Lucifer
in others. She is such a beauty I am surprised
Mr. Wells didn’t ask her to sit for him.”</p>

<p>“But he did ask you.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“I saw the sketch he made and of course I
recognized it.”</p>

<p>“Did he show it to you?”</p>

<p>“No. I came across it accidentally, and he
admitted that you were his subject.”</p>

<p>“Yet it isn’t very good.”</p>

<p>“Not very. We agreed that figure was not
his strong point.”</p>

<p>“It just happened,” Nan went on rapidly,
though she could not tell why she felt that she
need make an excuse. “Any one else would
have done who chanced to be on hand. It was
that day we had the picnic at Upper Pond.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I recognized the spot as well as the
figure. Nan, my child, don’t put your trust in
princes.”</p>

<p>Nan looked up startled. What did he mean?
What had he observed? She knew that her
friend, like all physicians, was given to close
observation. Did he guess that there was a
secret chamber in her heart where she had enshrined
Lohengrin? She picked up the book
which she had brought with her. “I thought
we were going to read,” she said with a nervous
laugh. “No, let’s go.”</p>

<p>She started to rise. The doctor sprang up
to help her to her feet. He held her hands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
his for a moment, looking down at the flushed
face and downcast eyes. “I have been reading,”
he said gravely.</p>

<p>Nan caught up her hat which had dropped
from her hold, settled it on her head, and led
the way to the open field. She said not a word
but kept ahead of the doctor along the narrow
path. At the edge of the piece of woods
where the camp was situated he came to her
side. “Nan,” he said, “are you angry with
me?”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Nan with a little uplift
of her head.</p>

<p>“Because of what I said just now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember your saying anything unusual,”
she returned and that was all the satisfaction
she gave.</p>

<p>But that evening when they had gathered to
start on the straw ride she avoided her old
friend, insisting upon Daniella’s sitting by her
on one side; the other was already occupied
by Marcus Wells, and she was the merriest of
the merry, so full of droll sayings, so originally
witty and bright that Marcus wondered. “You
are a creature of surprises,” he whispered as
the little company trooped up the street in
search of the “lickin’ good” ice-cream.</p>

<p>“Please to tell me why?” said Nan.</p>

<p>“You are usually so very quiet, such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
dream-maiden, but to-night you are like a star.
There is no moonlight in your make-up, it is
all star beams and twinkling lights, all scintillation
and sparkle. I thought I knew you,
but——”</p>

<p>“You see you didn’t,” returned Nan lightly
as they reached the door of the rustic ice-cream
room, or parlor, as it was called.</p>

<p>Many colored and ornately perforated papers
hung from the ceiling; on the little tables were
stiff bunches of paper flowers; on the floor oilcloth.
Behind the counter an apple-cheeked
woman stood aghast at the sudden descent of
so many customers. “We’ve got vanil’, lemon
and strawberry,” she said, “only I don’t know
as there’s enough to go round of any but the
vanil’.”</p>

<p>By dint of wise selecting it was discovered
that there would be enough to go around, and
after buying mint-sticks and lozenges, peanuts
and pop-corn, the jolly crowd again mounted
to their nest of straw and the wagon bumped
back to camp under a moonlit sky.</p>

<p>“Let’s make the welkin ring,” proposed Jo.</p>

<p>“What is a welkin?” asked Jean.</p>

<p>“It is a distant cousin to catkin,” Jo told her.</p>

<p>“Then how can it ring?”</p>

<p>“If a bell kin ring then a welkin ring,” returned
Jo nonsensically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“You are so silly. I don’t know any more
than I did before,” complained Jean.</p>

<p>“That’s because you don’t understand
poetry,” replied Jo loftily. Then some one
struck up, “Wait for the wagon!” and immediately
the welkin did ring very tunefully.
Effie was leading soprano, Nan sang alto,
Dr. Paul bass, Ran came in with a good tenor.
Hartley tried sometimes one thing, sometimes
another, and the rest did the best they could.</p>

<p>“I knew you had a voice,” whispered Mr.
Wells to Nan.</p>

<p>“I didn’t discover yours,” she returned laughing.</p>

<p>What had suddenly changed her? “It is
not your wont, star-lady, to cast reflections
upon your unworthy slaves.”</p>

<p>“What does a star do if it doesn’t cast reflections?”
demanded Nan. And then some
one began to sing their camping song so there
was no more chance for talk between any two,
and at parting Nan was as nonchalantly gay as
any one.</p>

<p>“Put not your trust in princes,” she said to
herself as she laid her head on her pillow. “I
don’t think any one could have discovered any
surplus amount of trust in my manner to-night.”
But she could not find it in her heart
to harbor resentment against her old friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
who had always been so kind, and it was not
really anger that she felt, but the natural withdrawing
of herself from the notice of one who
had surprised her secret, who had lifted the
curtain unannounced. What a good long talk
they had had before that. It was always so.
Heretofore she had never been more at ease
with any one than with Dr. Paul, but from
henceforth she feared there would be restraint.
She was sorry, for they had been such good
friends. She recalled his many acts of kindness.
Why had he tried to intrude upon her
fair thoughts? Why make the blunder of convicting
her with sentiments she had scarce confessed
to herself? It was too bad, too bad.
Yet however she might resent his speech, from
this time out Nan gave heed to Dr. Paul’s
warning, at least outwardly. The dream-maiden
was resolved into the “star-lady,” so
Marcus Wells took occasion to tell her whenever
they met.</p>

<small>MISS PINCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Pinch</span> has come. I saw her to-day.”
Jack gave the information.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Jo.</p>

<p>“I saw her this afternoon with Mr. Wells.
She has a new hat; it’s trimmed with poppies.
Mr. Pinch and the other girl were there, too.
The other girl’s hat is trimmed with lilacs.”</p>

<p>“Their name isn’t Pinch,” corrected Nan
sedately, looking up from her book.</p>

<p>“What is it then?”</p>

<p>“It is Romaine, and the young lady’s name
is Miss Mabel Romaine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care; I shall call them Pinch; it’s
good enough for such up-eyebrow people.”</p>

<p>Jo laughed. “What an expression. Tell us
about the encounter, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was getting out of the canoe, there
opposite Three Rocks, and they came along
the path. Mr. Wells called, ‘Hallo, Jack!’ and
I said, ‘Hallo!’ He stood still and was coming
over to talk to me, but the others walked on
with their eyebrows stretched up into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
middle of their foreheads, so he only said,
‘How’s everybody?’ and I said, ‘Very well,
thank you,’ then he overtook the others and
they went on up the lake path.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Not a very thrilling encounter,”
asserted Jo. “I suppose that’s the last of
Mr. Wells for us. He’ll tag these newcomers
all the time. Your nose is out of joint, Nan.”</p>

<p>Nan’s eyebrows went up quite as disdainfully
as ever Miss Romaine’s could. “I’m
sure,” she replied haughtily, “we got along
perfectly well before we knew Mr. Wells, and
I don’t see but that we can continue to do so.”
Yet in her heart of hearts she was conscious
of a feeling of bitter jealousy, and if she had
been alone the tears would have risen to her
eyes.</p>

<p>“The proper spirit, my dear; hear your
Aunt Jo tell you. We’ve plenty of good all
around friends; we don’t want any of the
summer sunshine, fair weather, take-you-when-I-can’t-get-any-one-else
kind.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” spoke up Mary Lee, “that if
you all were so deadly indifferent as you try
to appear, you would not make such a to-do
about it. For my part, I think you are a little
unjust to Mr. Wells.”</p>

<p>“And why?” Nan asked with still the “up-eyebrow”
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Because so far he has shown no sign of
neglecting us, and I am sure you wouldn’t expect
him to give up his friends on our account.
Suppose the case were reversed, and some of
our best friends, like Charlotte and Carter and
Phil Lewis, were to come, would we turn a cold
shoulder on them because we happened to have
met Mr. Wells?”</p>

<p>“But suppose they were scornful of our
friends and refused to meet them, would we
countenance it? and wouldn’t we tell them to
go to Halifax if they couldn’t join the crowd?”
Jo was speaking.</p>

<p>“Not if they were staying with us, were our
guests, so to speak, and the crowd happened to
be two or three miles away. Besides I don’t
see that we have given them a chance to prove
their intentions. They have only just come.
You couldn’t expect them to rush off to see us
the first thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Jo conceded. “Well, we’ll give
them a chance before we condemn them utterly,
won’t we, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course. I dare say Mary Lee is
right,” Nan admitted. She was glad that her
sister’s cooler judgment had set the matter in a
different light. It was certainly not to be expected
that the young man should have appeared
the very day that his friends had come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
nor that Dr. Paul should have done so either,
for as Mr. Wells’ guest he was bound to show
courtesy to these friends of his. “There’s one
person who won’t go back on us, I’ll venture
to say,” she spoke her thought aloud, “and
that is Dr. Paul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can count on him just as surely as
we can count on the sun’s rising every morning,”
Jo agreed with Nan, “and we’ll pump
him to find out how things are going on up
there.”</p>

<p>“You old gossip,” laughed Mary Lee.</p>

<p>But in spite of Nan’s brave front, as the days
went by and there was no sign of either Mr.
Wells or his friends, her heart misgave her.
She was in a dozen moods in the course of a
day. He had not forgotten them, but was in
the toils of an imperious creature whose demands
he must yield to on account of her
brother. He had forgotten and she was pensive
and hugged a fancy for dying of a broken
heart. He was angry because she and her
friends had not called upon his friends. Well,
what could he expect? Surely it was not their
place to make overtures. He was hurt because
Place o’ Pines was avoided and there were no
more afternoon teas. Ought they to go as if
nothing had happened? She dreamed of a
meeting in the woods when he would tell her of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
a fretful and spoiled girl to whom he had to be
polite rather than subject himself to reproaches
and maybe tears, of a meeting at the little point
opposite Three Rocks when he, sad and feeling
himself misunderstood, would bring his violin
that he might pour out his woes in music. She
would be there to hear, would suddenly appear
while he was playing the Swan Song, and he
would say, “I knew you would come. My heart
drew yours. We are twin souls.” Then she
would take from her bosom the little needle-case
and say, “This will tell you that I have been
thinking of you,” and he would take it and place
it next his heart, at the same time showing her
a withered flower she had once worn or a note
she had written and which he had treasured all
these days.</p>

<p>This was the sweetest dream of all, and once
she went with beating heart to the point, but
she saw him passing in a canoe with Miss Romaine
and returned in a meekly sad frame
of mind. Of course he preferred the other.
Why should he not? A gay and beautiful creature
with such a lovely name, Mabel Romaine.
What a contrast to plain Nancy Corner, a tall
unstylish creature, a schoolgirl who had never
learned coquetries and blandishments. What
could Nan expect? She would not die of a
broken heart, oh, no, but she would be true forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
to this high ideal, and when she was an
old woman they two would meet. He would
send for her on his death-bed and would say,
“Ah, yes, ah, yes, if I had only known that I
was marrying a butterfly I would not to-day be
the lonely and loveless old man I now am.”
Yes, that would be it, and she would say, very
softly, “You have never been loveless, Marcus,”
and then he would whisper, “Too late, too
late! I sinned against my best self, for I have
not been a success. I did not deserve so sweet
and pure a love as yours, Nancy. I bequeath
to you my grandson.”</p>

<p>Nan was really quite happy when she had
built up this romance, and thought of how she
would love the little Marcus Wells—an orphan
he would be—and she would always have him
for her very own. He would call her Grandma
Nancy and they would live together in a fine
old family mansion with a garden.</p>

<p>But as it is the unexpected which so often
happens, she did meet the young man when
she was not looking for him, at least she passed
him and Miss Romaine in her canoe. “Good-evening,”
he called out gaily. “Haven’t seen
you for an age. I’m coming over with the
doctor some evening.”</p>

<p>Nan’s only reply was, “Good-evening,” but
she heard his companion ask, “Who’s that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
Marcus?” and, because it was so still on the
water that sound carried readily, she heard him
reply, “Oh, one of those little schoolgirls down
at the camp. Nice child, but awfully young
and inexperienced.”</p>

<p>So she was only a “nice child,” in the same
category as Jack or Jean. This was a bitter
knowledge and she felt more unhappy than at
any time until she glided off into a new dream.
She was young, but she would grow older, become
a wonderful musician who could bring
tears to the eyes of all who heard her play, and
some day he would be in her audience,—it
would be in London,—and he would be humble
and mute before her. She would be dressed
magnificently and would wear flashing jewels.
People would crowd around her and he would
come up and say, “Don’t you remember me,
Miss Corner?” and she would remember but
she would say with a distant smile, “I am afraid
I do not remember,” and then he would ask,
“Don’t you remember we met one summer in
Maine? Have you forgotten Place o’ Pines?”
and she would answer, “Now you recall that, I
have a faint remembrance of it, but it is so long
ago and one meets so many persons, you know.
Did you play the flute, or was it the banjo?”
And he would frown and say, “I played the
violin a little but I am a painter,” and the reply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
would be, “Oh, yes, I remember you; Mr.
Romaine, isn’t it?” “No, Marcus Wells.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and your friend was Mr. Romaine,
that was it. Well, Mr. Wells, I am quite pleased
to have seen you after all these years. I beg
your pardon, Marquis, but did you say the
Duchess was waiting for me?” Then she
would sail away, leaving him feeling very small
and insignificant. This little drama was quite
as agreeable in its way as any of the others.</p>

<p>True to her purpose, Jo managed to get from
Dr. Paul some account of what was going on
at Place o’ Pines. The doctor never failed to
appear every day, alleging as fifth wheel to a
coach he was never missed from Place o’ Pines.
He had lengthened his stay at the entreaties of
the girls, as well as of the older ladies.</p>

<p>“What do they do with themselves up
there?” Jo asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, various things. Take long walks, have
supper on the rocks, afternoon tea at the studio.
Miss Romaine goes off sketching with Marc in
the morning, Miss Vanderver and Pinch take
a row on the lake, or she sits for him while
he makes pencil sketches. Sometimes I am
pressed into service for an illustration, but they
generally quite approve of my absence, I should
judge, although Marc will not allow me to
mention leaving for another week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Does Miss Romaine sketch?” asked Nan
with a little hesitancy at appearing to have any
interest at all in the young woman.</p>

<p>“A little, I believe. She calls herself Marc’s
pupil.”</p>

<p>“And Miss Vanderver?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t do anything but listen to Pinch’s
compliments. I believe that is a sure thing,
that affair. The young ladies have an ancient
great-aunt, or cousin or some one with them,
but she never appears except on rare occasions,
Pinch being supposed to be sufficiently a
guardian angel for his sister and she for her
friend. The aunt, a Mrs. Shepherd, sits on the
porch of the farmhouse and does knitting, I
take it, except when she is asleep or at meals.”</p>

<p>“Do you like the young ladies?” Mary Lee
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. They are harmless, rather silly,
but well versed in small talk and the society
column; you know the kind. I used to think
Marc had something in him over there in
Munich, but Pinch is only playing at being an
artist, at best. It would be much better for
Marc if he were to chum up with some of the
hard workers. He’ll lose the little grip he has
if he tries to follow Pinch’s lead. He maintains
that he is doing it for the sake of the acquaintance
it will give him among the rich and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
great who will buy his pictures, but ‘I hae me
doots.’”</p>

<p>Nan listened to all this with open ears, somewhat
resentful that Dr. Paul should impute such
motives to her hero, and believing that he
underrated his friend. “It’s not very nice of
him,” she told herself, and the next time they
were alone together she charged him with not
being a loyal friend, thereby considerably mystifying
the doctor, for he certainly had tried to
be loyal to her, he considered. But because
of all this Nan in her heart hugged the delusion
that the artist was a much abused and misunderstood
person who she could excuse for any of
these supposed shortcomings. Of course if Miss
Romaine were his pupil they had to go off in
company, particularly if Mr. Romaine and Miss
Vanderver were interested in one another. A
man had to be a little politic when he wanted to
succeed in a profession. Probably there was
no sentiment between them at all. And then
back again came the dream of a meeting on the
point, the violin, the Swan Song, and all the rest
of it.</p>

<p>All this which went on inside of Nan’s brain
was not guessed at by the other girls, for Nan
carefully guarded her thoughts and when at
last she finished the buttercups and the small
case, it was put away out of sight. If Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Wells ever asked for it he should have it; if
not she would keep it as a precious souvenir,
with a daisy he had once worn in his coat, and
a slip of paper on which he had written his
name and hers once when they were playing a
game together and he kept the score.</p>

<p>So the days went by, and though once in a
while some mention was made of Mr. Wells no
one seemed very unhappy because of his absence.
One afternoon he did stop for a few
minutes and Nan, in a contradiction which she
could not account for, flew to the woods and
hid herself. All that she learned later was that
he had been there, had stayed a few minutes,
had asked after every one who did not happen
to be on the premises, and had gone away
again.</p>

<p>“I suppose he went back to his Miss Pinch,”
said Jack who quite resented the disaffection of
the friend she had been the first to discover,
and who had always been particularly chatty
with her.</p>

<p>“I think he might have had the grace to
bring Mr. Pinch, or whatever his name is, to
call,” said Jo.</p>

<p>“Oh, what in the world should he do that
for? Very likely Mr. Romaine thinks we are
only a lot of children,” Mary Lee remarked.
“He is no chicken, you know; he must be at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
least twenty-five,” which to sixteen seemed a
veritable old bachelor.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, nobody wants him,” spoke up Ran.</p>

<p>“Here, too,” Hartley signified his endorsement
of this speech. “I can’t see why you
girls should want an old dandy like that dancing
around.”</p>

<p>“But Dr. Paul is older,” Jo rejoined.</p>

<p>“But he isn’t a dude; besides he is different
anyway,” Ran averred. “Let’s drop the old
fossil and talk about something more interesting.
Who’s for a horseback ride?”</p>

<p>“A horseback ride? For pity’s sake, where
can you get horses?” asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Hartley has discovered two which he thinks
are possible and he is going to take Daniella.
He says she can ride like a breeze. Nan, if I
can get the horses, will you go? Ashby and I
are going to see what we can get. What about
the rest of you?”</p>

<p>Jo didn’t ride, Effie only indifferently, so
Mary Lee was the only available companion
for Ashby. She, as well as Nan, could ride
“like a breeze” as Ran expressed it.</p>

<p>After some difficulty the horses were secured
and the party set out. The boys had scoured
the neighboring country, had been able to obtain
two old side saddles, and at Davis’s store
a new one. The horses were far from being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
high-bred steeds, but Daniella could ride anything,
Hartley declared, and was given the best
looking nag. Nan did not mind a trotting
beast, Mary Lee was mounted upon an old
white horse who had a fair gait and the boys
took what was left.</p>

<p>“There’s lots more fun in this sort of thing,
just for once,” said Ran, “than in riding our
own good steeds at home. This seems somehow
to fit the camp and other things. Do you
remember, girls, how we used to go riding up
the mountain at home? Doesn’t it remind you
of the old days?”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” asked Hartley.</p>

<p>“Oh, up the mountain,” Mary Lee told him.</p>

<p>“Past Place o’ Pines?”</p>

<p>“We shall have to.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start ahead.” As Hartley had
been the first to think of the expedition he had
been able to secure the best horses from a
farmer in the neighborhood. Daniella’s bay
mare would not allow anything to pass her and
kept ahead persistently.</p>

<p>Ran’s gray had a habit of stopping suddenly
as if to get breath, and then of starting on
again at a fast walk. Ashby’s old black would
break into a racking gallop at the smallest provocation
so that no two could keep the same
gait and the laughter which the various mounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
provoked nearly prevented the riders from keeping
their seats. Daniella, who had learned to
ride on her uncle’s ranch, and who had had
Mr. Scott himself for her teacher, was a very
Amazon. “There isn’t any stunt she can’t do,”
said Hartley admiringly, “and she’s promised to
try them all, from standing up in her saddle
to——”</p>

<p>“Jumping through a hoop,” put in Ran.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Hartley disgustedly. “I
didn’t mean circus tricks.”</p>

<p>“When we pass Place o’ Pines let’s go at
full tilt,” suggested Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“If we can,” returned Ashby dubiously.
“You go ahead, Mary Lee, and don’t mind me.
If I have to bring up the rear, why, I will.”</p>

<p>So those sitting in the studio over their tea
were suddenly surprised by the clatter of hoofs
along the road and saw a cavalcade go dashing
by, a big bay in the lead and a gaunt black,
lurching along in a plough-horse gallop, bringing
up the rear.</p>

<p>“Did you ever!” exclaimed Miss Romaine.
“Who in the world are those?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wells looked after them with a little half
wistful smile. “Some of my friends from Camp
Happiness, I judge.”</p>

<p>“But what a sorry looking set of beasts.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“Best they could get, probably, and much
better than none. How would you like to try
a ride some morning, Mabel?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like it at all unless you can
furnish a better mount than any of those,” she
said with an amused expression.</p>

<p>Marcus turned to his palette and for a few
minutes worked thoughtfully away. “The
Ride of the Valkyries” rang in his head. He
picked up his violin and softly began to finger
the strings, trying the cry of the wish-maiden,
and the splendid motif of the Ride. “It won’t
do,” he said putting down the violin. “One
instrument can’t begin to do it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” returned Miss Romaine,
setting down her teacup and picking up her
sketch-block. “I don’t see how you expected
it. Come over here, Marcus, and don’t waste
your time over that stuff. Tell me if this sky
is right now that it is dry.”</p>

<p>“A little rose madder is what you want,” said
the young man as he looked from her water-color
to the bit of lake she was trying to sketch.</p>

<p>In about an hour the cavalcade came back,
but at a slower pace. Miss Romaine had gone,
and the artist stood by the roadside alone.
“Take me to Walhalla, oh, Brunhilde,” he
cried as Nan came briskly trotting by.</p>

<p>“That is the place for heroes only,” she answered
back and went on well pleased with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
retort. Young and inexperienced she might be,
but she knew her Wagner better than Mabel
Romaine, she did not for a moment doubt.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it great?” said Ran as he lifted her
down. “We must try it again, Nan. I’ll speak
for that mare Daniella had; I noticed her
single-foot wasn’t bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be glad to go any time,” returned
Nan gathering up the skirt she had improvised
for the occasion. “It was great fun.”</p>

<p>“I enjoyed it, I can tell you,” Ran said with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“And on a beast with such a gait?” laughed
Nan.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking about the beast. I was
thinking about the company I had; that made
up for everything.”</p>

<p>“My, what a pretty speech,” replied Nan.
“You’ll soon be as gallant as Cousin Martin
Boyd, if you keep on,” and with a little mocking
smile she ran to her tent. Her eyes were like
stars. He did not forget. She almost sang
the words. Had not Siegfried been given a
magic potion, and did he not remember at
last? “He called me Brunhilde,” she said over
and over to herself, “and so he does remember;
he does not think I am a child as he pretended.
It was only pretense, I am sure.” So little food
did it take to nourish her fancies.</p>

<small>NAN HEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a day or two Dr. Paul’s holiday was over,
but before he left Nan overheard a conversation
between him, her aunt and her mother.
She had not meant to listen, but it seemed
forced upon her, for she was in her own tent
dressing and the three were sitting on the
porch of Mrs. Corner’s cabin just next. The
others were off on the lake and Nan had remained
behind to attend to some little matters.</p>

<p>“Marc will come to pay his respects before
he leaves,” she heard Dr. Paul say. “He has
a very friendly feeling for you all, but of course
these are his special chums and they are bound
to absorb him. I think he will be over to-morrow
as they all go off the next day.” So
soon! So soon! The end was nearing, Nan
realized.</p>

<p>“I must confess to being disappointed in
Mr. Wells,” said Miss Helen. “I fancy he is a
less serious young man than we imagined, a
butterfly sort of person who likes to be amused,
enjoys new sensations, is rather vain, something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
of a <i>poseur</i>, and who is rather selfish and
worldly.”</p>

<p>“He has that side to his nature, I admit,”
agreed Dr. Paul, “though at times he is serious
and one would think he had high standards.
When I first knew him in Munich he seemed as
much in earnest as any one I ever knew.”</p>

<p>“Then he is blown about by circumstances,”
Mrs. Corner remarked; “the kind of person
who is what influence makes him, not a very
strong character.”</p>

<p>“He is immensely popular, though, warm-hearted
and generous with his friends, and has
a way with him, a way of adapting himself to
the company he is in, and that is a great gift,
it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“It is if one is sincerely interested in the
things he appears to be,” rejoined Miss Helen,
“but a person can make a great pretense of
being this or that, a Bohemian to-day, a religious
to-morrow, a lover of high things at one
time, hand in hand with frivolity at another. Is
he like that?”</p>

<p>“I am not quite sure. He is an interesting
study, but he is young and one cannot tell
how he may develop. I think often that the
desire to try a variety of experiences will often
make very young persons appear all things to
all men, when really it is only a sort of eager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
curiosity which moves them. They are sincerely
interested in any novelty which comes
their way, and there is really no pretense about
it. In this case I think only time will prove
the real character. I am afraid this marriage
he is contemplating will not be for the development
of his best.”</p>

<p>Then he was going to marry. Nan’s heart
stood still. She dropped the comb she was
passing through her long hair, and buried her
face in her hands for a moment.</p>

<p>She heard the doctor’s voice again. “He
says he must thank you all for a very pleasant
experience. He thinks Jack is such an original,
and is greatly pleased with his study of
her which he thinks is one of the best things he
has done. He hopes to exhibit it with your
permission. As for the sketch he made of Nan
he keeps it for what it is, a mere sketch. He
has enjoyed Nan, too, but in a different way.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” There was a little sharp
ring in Mrs. Corner’s voice.</p>

<p>“Well, he says she is so responsive. He has
liked to watch her thrill and glow under his
music. He has liked to play upon her emotions,
to see her eyes burn like stars, and a
dawning light of woman’s perception come into
her face. She is an interesting study, he says.
He never met so young a girl who promised so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
much and he hopes he will see how she matures.
He has played upon her emotions as he
does upon his violin to see what tones he can
bring forth, and”—the doctor paused, “I resented
it.”</p>

<p>“You told him so? I wouldn’t have done
that, Paul.” Mrs. Corner it was who said this.</p>

<p>“Oh, I simply told him he had no business
to build up fanciful dream castles for Nan’s imagination
to dwell in, that she has too much
imagination as it is, and as a physician I forbade
any more such nonsense, that he had no
right to amuse himself with her temperamental
growth.”</p>

<p>“And what did he say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he laughed and promised not to ‘steep
her soul in the magic of music any more’ as he
put it, and that he wouldn’t ‘tear the pretty
flower of her heart to pieces simply to classify
it.’ You know the way he talks.”</p>

<p>“In a way that is very fetching to a romantic
young woman,” sighed Miss Helen. “And is
that the reason why he hasn’t been coming so
often?”</p>

<p>“It is one reason, though I fancy his fiancée
doesn’t allow him to stray very far from her
side.”</p>

<p>“He is really in love with her, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, or thinks he is, which amounts to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
same thing. He has been devoted to her for
some time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we must give him credit for
listening to your warning,” Mrs. Corner remarked.
“Not every young man would
have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is a gentleman, and if he is thoughtless,
it may be attributed to the youth of him.
I’ve no fault to find with Marc as a friend, and
wouldn’t discuss him with any less interested
than yourselves, but I wanted you to know
some of these things I have been telling you.
I thought it was only due to you and to him,
too. Where is Nan, Mrs. Corner?”</p>

<p>“I think she has gone off with some of the
others for a walk, though I am not sure. I
heard Ran ask her if she didn’t want to go,”
the reply came.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go meet them,” the doctor decided.
Nan heard his footsteps on the plank
walk which had been laid from her mother’s
cabin to the larger one, and then in a few minutes
she heard her mother say:</p>

<p>“Nan is not like herself this summer. She is
moody, sometimes wildly gay, sometimes so
pensive and sad it makes me afraid she is in
trouble. She has always confided in me or in
you, Helen, but this summer she seems almost
to avoid us, and she goes off by herself a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
deal. The girls have noticed it and it has hurt
them a little.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” Nan in her tent gave
voice to a sigh.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought”—Miss Helen
hesitated, “that she had taken a fancy to
Marcus Wells?”</p>

<p>“Why, no.” Mrs. Corner’s voice showed
surprise.</p>

<p>“I have thought so.” Miss Helen was the
speaker. “You have just heard what Paul
said. He is no unobservant person, and is not
a suspicious one, yet I think he suspects that
Nan has been touched by a romantic fancy, and
he wanted to let us understand something of
what we might look for, as well as to give us a
clear knowledge of how matters were with Marc
Wells.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Helen, the poor little girl!”</p>

<p>“My dear Mary, Nan is eighteen or nearly
so. She is an intensely romantic, imaginative
girl, and you may well believe she has her day-dreams
as all girls of her age have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but she would have come to me.”</p>

<p>“Did you go to your mother or any one else,
at her age, with all your dreams?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Helen, why, I suppose not. How careless
I have been. I should never have allowed
her to go off that way to listen to him playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
the violin. I ought to have known better, but
she seemed such a child and it gave her so
much pleasure. What folly in me not to realize
that he was just the kind of person to attract a
girl like Nan, a young, good-looking artist,
musical, and with poetical fancies. I can see
just how it happened, now it is too late.”</p>

<p>“Not too late; we can scarcely say that of a
girl’s first little whimsy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I have been blinded by other
thoughts for Nan. One is prone to believe in
what one most desires.”</p>

<p>Nan did not understand this speech. Next
she heard her Aunt Helen say, “Heretofore I
have no doubt she has had visions of some
hero of an unreal world, some creature of imagination,
some Sir Galahad, and has woven
her fancies about him. That is what all girls
do, and then comes the next step when they fix
their thoughts upon some human being who is
probably not in the least like their ideal, but
whom imagination clothes in all the attractive
qualities. This being may have shown himself
to possess one such quality and that is enough
for a vivid fancy like Nan’s. She invests him
with all the rest.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner spoke next. “Yes, I remember
now that my first hero was Gilliatt in Victor
Hugo’s ‘Toilers of the Sea,’ and, strange to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
say, by some peculiar method of sequence I
can’t account for, my next was the young assistant
at our church. I used to wrap myself
in a big shawl on cold days, and sit at our attic
window to see him go by, and if he passed me
on the street, that was a red-letter day.”</p>

<p>“And yet no one knew of this.”</p>

<p>“Not a soul. Half the pleasure was in the
mysterious secrecy.”</p>

<p>“Just what I said. My first craze was for
the organist. I recall that he had Hyacinthine
curls and wore a cloak. I used to steal into
church when he was practicing and sit there
lost in a rhapsody, then I would slip out when
he had stopped playing, and would wait at the
gate to see him come from the church. I
thought him the most wonderful being in the
world. I couldn’t have been more than sixteen.”</p>

<p>There was a little duet of laughter.</p>

<p>“Before that,” Miss Helen continued, “I was
in love with my Sunday-school teacher. She
was a heavenly goddess to me, and I envied
the very glove she wore because it touched her
hand.”</p>

<p>“And I felt the same way about one of the
older girls at school.” Mrs. Corner gave her
experience. “What dainties I saved for her.
What gifts I hoarded to bestow upon her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
how unhappy I was when she wouldn’t let me
walk home with her. Her name, if I remember
correctly, was Samantha Farley, and she had
red curly hair.”</p>

<p>Another little tinkle of laughter came to
Nan’s ears.</p>

<p>“So, you see,” Miss Helen took up the conversation
again, “our dear little Nan’s is no
unusual case. She will recover and, I hope,
will marry some good man when she is old
enough.”</p>

<p>“As I did,” said Mrs. Comer.</p>

<p>Nan shook her head. They did not take
her seriously. They did not know that this
was the love of her life, that it would be impossible
for her to change. She waited for
the next words which came from her aunt.
“And yet, no doubt the dear thing imagines
her affections are securely placed, the poor
darling.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had looked ahead a little; we
might have prevented this.” It was Mrs.
Comer who spoke.</p>

<p>“How could we? It would have seemed
unreasonable to say to the young man, ‘We
can’t have you coming here because we are
afraid one of our girls will fall in love with
you.’ Suppose, too, he had been honestly attracted
to her, what then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“Oh, we couldn’t have permitted anything
so serious as that. He is not the kind of man
for Nan.” Mrs. Corner was confident.</p>

<p>“There’s no one good enough for Nan, if it
comes to that,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, Helen, we must not worry. I hope
there is no great harm done. She will probably
never see our artist again. If he is to
marry she is not likely to, and thus an end to
that. Ah, my dear, I wish I could keep them
all children. I begin to tremble for my darling
girls as I see them facing womanhood.” Mrs.
Corner gave the final word.</p>

<p>Then Nan heard the chairs moved back and
there was nothing more heard. Her brain was
in a whirl. The mists of imagination were
beginning to part to show realities. She wondered
if her Aunt Helen still thought of the
organist, and if that was the reason she had
never married, but no, she remembered a little
photograph of a young man in Confederate
gray, which she had once come across in looking
through a box of old letters her mother
had, and she had asked, “Who is this, mother?”
“The young man who would have been your
Aunt Helen’s husband, if he had lived,” her
mother had told her. “He was killed at
Gettysburg.” Nan had thought at the time
this was probably why her aunt’s hair had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
turned gray so early. “No wonder,” she
sighed as she fastened her belt around her
slender waist.</p>

<p>She slipped out at the back of the tent and
walked slowly through the woods, turning over
in her mind the conversation she had just listened
to. “If a man were married of course it
would be a dreadful thing for a girl to continue
to think of him.” She mustn’t do that, and
why should she—if he didn’t care for her?
He was not Lohengrin, nor she Elsa. He was
not Siegfried nor she Brunhilde; that was
all as unreal as the characters themselves.
Plain matter-of-fact truth was that Marcus
Wells had been entertained in playing with
her as two children play. It had meant nothing
whatever to him but pastime. He was
in love with another girl and they were to be
married. She quite understood his fanciful
way of speaking of his analysis of her; “he
wouldn’t tear the pretty flower of her heart to
pieces just to classify it”; so she was nothing
more than a specimen to be stuck through with
a pin and pinned to the wall of his experience.
She gave a little gasp. She could not, and
would not meet him again.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul made his farewells that evening to
a very quiet, thoughtful Nan. “I shall see
you at Christmas, I hope,” he said. “You expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
to be at home for the holidays, your mother
says.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall go to Aunt Sarah,” she answered
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Don’t work too hard, little girl,” he said
pressing her hand. “I’m glad you are to be
among friends.” And that was the last of
Dr. Paul for some months.</p>

<p>Nan kept out of the way all the next day,
not even appearing at dinner. She took some
lunch in her pocket and spent the morning in
her woodland haunt. In the afternoon she
went with Ran for a horseback ride, and she
left the supper table before the others. As she
passed her mother she leaned over and whispered,
“Don’t worry, dearest. I’m not going
far, and please don’t let them look me up. I’ll
tell you why some time.”</p>

<p>Her mother understood, and when a little
later Marc Wells appeared, Nan was not to be
found.</p>

<p>“I believe she is mourning after Dr. Paul,”
declared Jo, “for we have scarcely seen her all
day.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Paul?” Mr. Wells knitted his brows.
“Well, please make my adieux.” He left a
small sketch for Mrs. Corner, delighted Jack
with a photograph of the picture for which she
had posed, and when Nan entered her tent at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
bedtime, she saw a tiny note pinned to her
cushion and a package by the side of it. The
note read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Farewell, Brunhilde! You are cruel to hide
away in this manner. Loge guards you well,
for you are not to be found. I hope you will
not forget to send me word when you get to
New York. You must remember that you
have an engagement to come to one of our
studio teas. I enclose my card so you cannot
make the excuse of not knowing the address.
I hope you will like the little sketch and the reminder
of</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Siegfried</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nan opened the package to see a small water-color
study of Place o’ Pines, the name written
underneath, and a photograph of Marcus
Wells in his Siegfried dress. The little log
cabin in the green-wood, with a shimmer of lake
just beyond, made a pretty sketch. The photograph
was posed with the horn uplifted after
the manner of one of Knote which Nan had
shown the artist.</p>

<p>She laid the gifts away, a sharp pang at
heart, and went to bed, but not to sleep. The
lights were all out and the camp very still when
suddenly she heard the joyous notes of the
Siegfried call, the “Son of the Woods.” Had
she been asleep and dreaming? No, there it
was again, nearer. She sprang up, slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
on her wrapper, and drew on her shoes, then
she stole out into the starlit night and through
the wooded ways to the border of the lake. A
canoe with a light at its prow was gliding over
the water. There was a soft plash of the paddles
and presently again the sound of the horn.
Then Nan distinguished a figure standing up
with horn at lips. It was so quiet she could
hear the voices of those in the boat.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to do that, Marc,” she made
out a man’s voice. “You will wake up all
those little schoolgirls at camp.”</p>

<p>“It would take more than my tooting to disturb
their innocent slumbers, the little dears,”
the answer came.</p>

<p>Nan watched the boat disappearing into the
dimness of the night, but heard the dipping of
paddles and the tinkle of laughter after the
canoe was lost to view. So did her hero pass
out of her sight as dramatically as he had entered,
and so was Nan’s first romance ended.</p>

<p>She stole back to her tent, chilled by the cool
night air, and crept shiveringly under the covers.
Once in a while a tear would steal from
under her closed lids to fall upon her pillow as
she lay with hands tightly locked over her
throbbing heart. Who drives a sun chariot
falls far, and Nan was bruised and hurt after
her wild plunge from heaven to earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>She was pale and wide-eyed the next morning
when she took her note and gifts to show
her mother. “My blessed lamb,” murmured
Mrs. Corner folding her arms around the girl.</p>

<p>Nan dropped her head on her mother’s
shoulder. “I heard all you and Aunt Helen
and Dr. Paul were saying out there on the
porch the other day,” she confessed. “I was in
the tent dressing, and I could not come out,
and I heard. I wanted to tell you before, but I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Dearest daughter, I understand.”</p>

<p>“I know you do, but oh, mother, it hurts, oh,
it hurts.”</p>

<p>“My precious child, I know, I know.” Her
mother held her close, her cheek against the
girl’s bowed head.</p>

<p>Nan was very still for a few minutes, then she
said hesitatingly, “Did you feel so when you
woke up from your dream about the young
clergyman? What woke you, mother?”</p>

<p>She did not see the smile which came over
her mother’s face at the recollection of her disillusionment.
“I saw him eating roast goose
and onions, with the perspiration standing out
upon his forehead. It was at a church supper,
and I heard him say, ‘If the quail which fed the
children of Israel were anything like this roast
goose I don’t wonder they sighed for the flesh-pots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
of Egypt.’ I watched him consume two
mighty plates of the supper, smack his greasy
lips, and pick his teeth with such an expression
of carnal delight as completely disenchanted
me, and I realized that the saintly priest in
white robes was not the every-day man eating
a good dinner.”</p>

<p>Nan lifted her head and the two smiled at
one another. “But had you really cared?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I thought so, but it was an imaginary caring.
I was in love with an idea not a person.
I never loved but one, Nan.” Her voice was
very solemn and tender.</p>

<p>“And that was—father?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They drew closer together and neither spoke
for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Mother dear,” Nan asked presently, “how
old were you when you saw the young curate
eat roast goose?”</p>

<p>“About your age, dearie.”</p>

<p>“And how long after that did you meet
father?”</p>

<p>“I had known him long before, but I didn’t
recognize my ideal lover in John Corner. That
came later. Remember, Nan dear, ‘when half-gods
go, the gods arrive.’”</p>

<p>Here some one came to the cabin door. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
mother went to open and then stepped out on
the porch. Nan picked up her picture and the
note; the former she would put away with the
buttercup case; the latter she tore into small
bits and threw these on the open fire before
which she was standing; then she watched with
a grave face till the last fragment smouldered
into white ashes.</p>

<small>BREAKING CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were but a few days left of camp life.
Hartley must return to Harvard, Effie would
enter upon her last year at the Wadsworth
school where Daniella, too, would go. Ran
would go back to his law school, Ashby to the
university, Jo was looking forward with some
misgivings to her first year at college, but was
so rejoiced that Nan was to be one of her classmates
that she averred it took away half her
dread. Mary Lee and the twins would return
to Miss Cameron, and on the way home the
Corners would stop for a day at Cousin Maria
Hooper’s.</p>

<p>“We must do something to celebrate,” declared
the boys.</p>

<p>“What shall it be?” asked Ran. “We
might send off fireworks on the lake.”</p>

<p>“That would be one thing if we could get
them in time,” Hartley fell in with this.</p>

<p>“No doubt Al Davis has some left over from
his Fourth of July stock; we’ll see,” Ran rejoined.</p>

<p>“We might have a regular breaking camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
the way the darkies do at camp-meeting,” suggested
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“We could do that,” agreed the others.</p>

<p>“Let’s arrange a programme,” proposed
Ashby, taking out his note-book and pencil.</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t that just like Ash?” said Ran;
“he always wants everything down in black
and white.”</p>

<p>“Best way,” Ashby answered, “then there’s
sure to be no mistake. What first? I suppose
we ought to have some sort of feed to make it
jollier.”</p>

<p>“And some kind of stunt besides fireworks,”
specified Hartley.</p>

<p>“Come, Nan, you and Jo are the ingenious
ones; stir up your brains and give us a programme,”
demanded Ran.</p>

<p>“Speeches,” suggested Nan. “You can be
one of the orators, Ran; it will get your hand
in. Jo can do one of her funny monologues.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that. Can’t you
leave me out?” Jo began to protest.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course you will. Come on,
Jo.” Voices urged her on every side, and she
gave in.</p>

<p>“Pity we couldn’t have the phonograph
again for some music,” said Hartley, “but
there isn’t time. You might give us a banjo
solo, Ash.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>“And Ran can sing some coon songs; he’s
great at that.” Mary Lee suggested this.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with a sort of minstrel
show? We needn’t black up,” proposed Ran.</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired Hartley. “Here’s
the lake handy to remove the burnt cork.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see. Put it down, Ash. Now,
let’s see, I suppose we ought to begin with a
feed. What shall it be, Jean? You’re the
authority on wittles.”</p>

<p>“If we had ice we could have ice-cream, for
the cream is easy to get from the farmhouse,”
replied Jean.</p>

<p>“So’s the ice easy to get; we’ll look into
that. Well, suppose we say ice-cream and
cake, though it seems to me something warmer
would be more comforting; the nights are
chilly,” Ran remarked.</p>

<p>“Jean could eat ice-cream sitting on an iceberg
with her feet in a snow-drift,” remarked Jo.
“Let’s have something warm if we can, Jean.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we have an old time country feast,”
Daniella proposed, “nuts and cider, apples and
gingerbread.”</p>

<p>“Something typical of the region? It
wouldn’t be bad. Cider and apples are plentiful
enough, and we can bribe Hetty to make
the gingerbread, while as for nuts, if we can do
no better we’ll have peanuts. We might toast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
marshmallows, too, if any one cares for them
after having so many this season.” Jo was the
speaker.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with a corn-roast?” inquired
Ashby.</p>

<p>“All right. The best yet. Good boy!”
cried Hartley. “Put her down. Now read.”</p>

<p>“Early evening, minstrel show, followed by
corn-roast and fireworks; that simplifies matters.
Speeches and stunts included in show;
fireworks as finale,” Ashby read from his note-book.</p>

<p>“What do we do to break camp, as you call
it?” inquired Effie.</p>

<p>“Oh, we must march around camp singing,
then shake hands and go to bed. We needn’t
keep it up all night the way the negroes do
sometimes,” Mary Lee told her.</p>

<p>“We might get up a song for the occasion,”
observed Ran. “Well, I think that is a pretty
good programme, as much as we can get
through. Nan, you and Jo can get up the
jokes and things; Mary Lee and the rest can
attend to the costumes; we boys will see about
the speeches, the corn for the roast and the
fireworks; that disposes of the whole business.”</p>

<p>Ashby wrote the list down and the party
scattered, intent upon the immediate carrying
out of their plans. Therefore very soon Nan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
and Jo had their heads together giggling over
some absurd jokes, Ran was marching up and
down with head bent, intent upon his speech,
Mary Lee and the other girls were consulting
their elders in the matter of costume while Hartley
and Ashby started off for a forage for corn
and fireworks.</p>

<p>Miss Marshall and Miss Lloyd never failed to
further anything in reason, and proposed that
the costumes be nothing more elaborate than
the ordinary camp dress. “If you black up,”
said Miss Lloyd, “you will be sufficiently prepared
for a show of this kind and you can
brighten your costumes by wearing different
colored handkerchiefs. Are you all to take
part in the minstrel show?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, only the three boys, Nan, Jo and
myself,” Mary Lee told her. “The rest want
to be audience, so there will be only six to perform.”</p>

<p>“Quite enough considering the size of the
audience. Very well, anything we can do to
help, please believe we shall be glad to do.”
So the flock went off to report to Nan and Jo.</p>

<p>They found these two cudgeling their brains
for proper words to use in something they were
writing. “Ate, state, fate.” Jo had her pencil
poised. “Which sounds better, Nan? So
from this good old camp we must be getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
on a gait, or, For we must all be traveling just
as sure as fate?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jo, the first is so slangy and the second
isn’t much better. Let me see. Why not say:
We must be departing for the season’s waxing
late?”</p>

<p>“Departing is so formal. We don’t want a
song to be sung on a college platform before
a row of professors. I object to departing.
Why not say: Now we must be going for the
season’s getting late?”</p>

<p>“That’ll do. I think it really sounds better.
Hallo, girls. We are getting into shape. I
think one more stanza will complete this beautiful
song. You all must learn it so as to sing it
when we march around camp.”</p>

<p>“It is to the tune of John Brown’s body,”
Jo told them. “Here’s the first verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>“Go on,” begged the girls. “Let’s have the
rest.” And Jo consented to read the other
lines.</p>

<p>“You see,” Jo laid down her paper, “the beauty
of this is that we don’t have to have any rhymes,
only meter, and it is a sort of hymny thing appropriate
for a camp. Of course the Glory,
glory hallelujah comes in to make it more like
a camp-meeting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>“It’s perfectly fine, Jo. How did you come
to think of it?” asked the girls.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was Nan’s idea, as you might know.
She started it and I helped out with the lines.
I’m going to do an Irish monologue and we
have some good jokes. Noahdiah Peakes ought
to be here to ask conundrums.”</p>

<p>“That gives me an idea,” said Nan jotting
something down on the margin of her paper.</p>

<p>The boys, who had gone off in the wagon,
returned with a pile of roasting ears, and some
mysterious articles which they hustled into their
tent.</p>

<p>“Did you get any fireworks?” asked Jack
on the alert.</p>

<p>“We did, indeed,” Ran told her. “We
bought out all that Al Davis had, and I think
we shall have quite a show.”</p>

<p>“Are they what you took into the tent?” inquired
Jack, her curiosity still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>“Shan’t tell you,” returned Ran with a mischievous
smile. He was a tall lad, with blue
eyes and sandy hair, not handsome but with a
frank, pleasant face that at once inspired confidence.
Ashby was not so tall. He had the
same colored hair but his eyes were gray. He
was a little shy, but was always ready to do
anything for others he could, but always did it
in a quiet, unassuming way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>There was much scurrying to and fro for the
rest of the day, much laughter and fun over the
arrangements for the evening.</p>

<p>“I am glad we have something to occupy
us,” said Daniella as they sat down to dinner,
“for the breaking up of a good time always
does make me sad.”</p>

<p>“Then you have had a good time, Danny,
and are glad you came,” Miss Helen said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad. I have never had such a
good time.”</p>

<p>“Not even in Europe?”</p>

<p>“No, because it was all so strange and new,
and I was trying so hard to understand and
take in everything, while here I’ve been with
you all and it has been so free. There were no
lessons, no strange languages, no buildings I
ought to know about, no pictures I ought to see.”</p>

<p>Miss Helen smiled at the frank confession.
It was evident that while Daniella’s trip to
Europe had been of great benefit in the matter
of education, it had weighed rather heavily
upon her at the time.</p>

<p>Presently Mary Lee came in and drew up her
chair with a sigh of fatigue. “I’m tired,” she
said. “I do hate to pack, but I have about
finished.”</p>

<p>“You are forehanded, Mary Lee,” said her
aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>“Oh, but you know I like to get things done.
The rest said they wouldn’t pack till morning
as they might want some of their things this
evening, but I have put aside exactly what I
shall need and can stuff them in the last thing.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that just like Mary Lee?” said Daniella.
“She is so orderly that I believe she’d
be standing ready dressed with a hand satchel
if the house caught on fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I always keep my bag ready packed,”
replied Mary Lee in a matter-of-fact way. “I
can snatch it up at any minute.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you?” Daniella laughed and
nodded at Miss Helen.</p>

<p>Here Jo came in. “Hurry up, girls,” she
said. “We have something on hand to do
right after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up yourself,” Nan told her. “You’re
a great one. Here we have nearly finished our
dinner and you have just come in. What is
the special rush?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to get things to deck the hall.”</p>

<p>“They will all have to be taken right down
again,” said Mary Lee practically.</p>

<p>“Well, ’Lish can do it after we go. We
don’t have to consider anything but the putting
up.” She hurried through with her meal and
rushed out to join the others who, with the
boys, were waiting to set out for the woods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
The boys were armed with hatchets ready to
chop off green boughs for decorations, leaving
the girls to gather leaves already turning, and
the red berries of the wild rose.</p>

<p>With armfuls they returned to the big cabin
where they made a veritable bower to the contempt
of ’Lish whom they called upon for nails
and string. “Fool nonsense, I call it,” he muttered,
“fetchin’ all that there truck to litter up
the place. Some folks ain’t got a mite of common
sense. Why can’t they leave things be?
I can’t see as it’ll make their wittles taste any
better to have the place look like a bé-zar.”
However, he was willing enough to help, for it
was his way to grumble a little and then be all
the readier afterward.</p>

<p>They all had a busy day of it, but their enthusiasm
never flagged and if they were tired by
supper time each and all insisted that all they
needed was a little food to make them as ready
for fun as ever. The days were much shorter
and they needed all the lanterns in camp to
light up the place. The lights were hung
around the impromptu stage, gleaming from between
green boughs and casting a glow upon
the red and yellow leaves. Hartley’s was the
first appearance, and here Jack discovered what
was so mysteriously hurried to the boys’ tent,
for Hartley was made up as Noahdiah Peakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
and came in pushing himself along on a ridiculous
little wagon with a toy horse, these having
been discovered at Davis’s store. The old
jokes were made, the old conundrums asked
each to the customary accompaniment of “Git
ap!” This was Nan’s idea, the one she had
jotted down that morning on the margin of her
paper, and it made a great hit. Then came the
minstrels, Hartley keeping his costume, but
adding a coat of black cork to his hands and
face. Ashby with his banjo was one of the end
men, Ran with bones was the other. They did
some funny coon songs interspersing the performance
with jokes. Then Mary Lee gave
her breakdown which was so applauded that
she did another typical dance. Nan gave an
imitation of an opera singer with no voice at all,
then Jo, who had gone out to get rid of her burnt
cork, returned to do an Irish monologue. She
was a great mimic and her brogue brought
much applause. After the finale, an old camp-meeting
hymn, sung in chorus, they all trooped
out to the field back of the camp where ’Lish
had been instructed to build a fire, and here
they had the corn-roast. The boys had prepared
a pile of sharpened sticks, and if the corn
was frequently smoked and charred it was relished
by most of the party.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jo Returned to do an Irish Monologue.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Now the fireworks!” cried Jack who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
much interested in these. To the lake they
took their way to set off pinwheels and roman
candles, and to send up rockets which went
hissing down into the lake. At the last a great
rocket bomb started the echoes and sent frightened
birds flying from their nests in the near-by
trees.</p>

<p>Then every one, even ’Lish and Hetty, joined
in the procession which marched around the
camp singing their song. More verses were
added as a line would be suggested and the
marching was kept up enthusiastically till the
older ones declared themselves tired. At the
close every one solemnly shook hands all
around and it was declared that they had “done
broke camp” as Hetty expressed it. She made
a little bobbing curtsey to all. “I sholy is disinclined
to part with yuh-alls,” she said. “It
seem lak ole times to hev dese yer cay’ins on.
I ain’t been to no veritas camp-meetin’ fo’ many
a long ye’r, an’ yuh-alls is such nice ladies an’
gemmans dat I hopes to see yuh-alls nex’ ye’r,”
a wish which was echoed by one and all.</p>

<p>Then some one raised “Three cheers for
Camp Happiness!” and then “Three cheers
for Miss Marshall and Miss Lloyd!” so the
cheering was kept up till a curious little squirrel,
wakened by all this hullabaloo, came scampering
out of his nest and sat on his haunches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
looking around inquiringly as if to say, “Why
all this fuss, friends?” The squirrels had become
very tame, for every one fed them, and
no one thought of scaring them off, much less
of hurting them.</p>

<p>In a short time every lantern and candle was
out, the tents gleamed white in the moonlight.
Before another week the place would be silent
save for the lonely call of a night-bird or the
pad of some four-footed creature prowling the
woods.</p>

<p>All this came to Nan’s mind as she turned on
her pillow. She thought of Place o’ Pines deserted
and boarded up as she had seen it for
the last time. “I shall never come back,” she
sighed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day saw Noahdiah with a stage full
of passengers and such a pile of luggage as he
declared he “didn’t know as he’d ever be able
to h’ist on.” However the boys helped with
strong arms as well as with suggestions and
finally the whole twelve persons were safely
stowed away with their trunks roped on at the
back, piled on top or serving as seats. The
Corners left the train at Sebago that they might
make the promised visit to Cousin Maria, while
the others went on to Boston, the Gordon boys
to continue their journey to Virginia, Hartley
and Effie, with Daniella, to return to their
home, while Jo turned off to go to her aunt’s
where she would stay till she should be ready
to start for college.</p>

<p>The Corners felt that they must hurry for
there were the bridesmaid dresses to be made
and the wedding presents to be bought for Miss
Dolores, so they did not tarry anywhere till
New York was reached. “I can scarcely wait
to see Miss Dolores,” said Mary Lee when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
had reached their hotel. “I’m going to call
her up first thing.”</p>

<p>“Do wait till you have washed your face,”
replied Nan. “It is all over cinders; you
would have the car window open.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had to; the cars were so hot and
stuffy after living in the open air all these
weeks.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t have to call her up the
instant you get in.”</p>

<p>Mary Lee concluded she could take time to
remove the cinders, but she did not delay long
after that, and when she returned from the
telephone she was as excited as it was in the
power of Mary Lee to be. “What do you
think, Nan?” she exclaimed. “Mercedes is
coming to-morrow and Miss Dolores wants us
to come up to dinner, stay all night and go
with them first thing in the morning to meet
the steamer. They think it will be in by half-past
eight or nine, so we shall have to make an
early start. Won’t it be fun?”</p>

<p>“It will be fine,” Nan responded heartily.
“Does she want all of us to come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, only our two selves who know
Mercedes. I’ll go ask mother, then I’m to
telephone Miss Dolores. She is so glad we
reached here in time.” She went off, presently
returning to say that Mrs. Corner had no objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
to the arrangement. “Please hurry,
Nan, while I go to the telephone,” said Mary
Lee.</p>

<p>“But why hurry? The steamer isn’t coming
in to-night.” Nan liked to tease Mary Lee.
“There is plenty of time before dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Nan, don’t you want to see
Miss Dolores and her trousseau, and Mr. St.
Nick?”</p>

<p>Nan laughed. “First best, Miss Dolores,
second best, her clothes, third best, dear old
Mr. St. Nick. I think I put him first, myself,
and of course I am dying to see the trousseau.”</p>

<p>“And not Miss Dolores? You’re very
peculiar, I must say.” Mary Lee was up in
arms.</p>

<p>“Of course I want to see her. You must be
stupid to think I don’t, but Mr. St. Nick is a
little bit dearer and the clothes are more of a
novelty, so there you are.”</p>

<p>Mary Lee walked off with her nose in the
air. “Very well,” she remarked as she went
out, “I shall go the minute I am ready, and if
you prefer to come later, I shall not object.”</p>

<p>Nan laughed provokingly, but went on with
brisk preparations as soon as the door closed
after Mary Lee. She wanted to go early quite
as much as her sister, but Mary Lee was
always such a precise and unhurried person it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
was but seldom that one had a chance to tease
her and the opportunity was too good to lose.
She made such haste and Mary Lee was so
long at the telephone that when she came back
Nan was all ready. “Oh,” exclaimed the latter,
“I was just about to go. I thought perhaps
you had changed your mind. Suppose I start
on since you’ll not be dressed for at least half
an hour.”</p>

<p>“Nan Corner, if you go without me I’ll
never forgive you. I think you are just
horrid.”</p>

<p>“But you were going without me all right,
all right.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite another thing.”</p>

<p>“Can’t seem to see it, but rather than ruffle
your feathers any more I’ll go to mother and
Aunt Helen and you can stop by for me when
you’ve done prinking.”</p>

<p>So saying she left Mary Lee to herself and it
is needless to say that if it were within Mary
Lee to hurry she did it on this occasion. In
consequence in considerably less than half an
hour the two were leaving the hotel for Mr.
Pinckney’s home. They had been in New
York often enough to know the way fairly well.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinckney was watching at the window
for them and came bustling out in his hearty
way, crying, “Here you are! Bless your hearts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
I am glad to see you. Come right in. Well,
well, isn’t this great? We must have you
right here with us till after the wedding.
Where are you staying? I’ll telephone them to
send up your baggage. Where is Dolores?
Fisher, tell Miss Dolores the young ladies have
come.”</p>

<p>Then in a moment Miss Dolores came running
down-stairs to be hugged and kissed and
to tell them all her news.</p>

<p>Having decided that the two girls were to
remain in the house till after the wedding Mr.
Pinckney could not rest till he had the matter
settled. He would fain have had the other two,
but Mrs. Corner compromised by promising
they should come on the wedding day to
remain till Miss Dolores returned from her
bridal trip, Jack herself telling him that he
would need them more then and that it should
be her business to see that he was not lonely.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was in high good humor
after this. He confessed to Nan in confidence
that no one knew how he had dreaded the two
weeks during which his granddaughter should
be away. “But it is all right now,” he said.
“I shan’t mind it, not at all.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not,” Nan threatened. “If we
four Corners aren’t enough for you I must say
you are hard to please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“Conceited little minx,” said Mr. Pinckney,
but he rubbed his hands and chuckled every
time he looked at the two.</p>

<p>There was a delightful hour after dinner
when Mr. Pinckney was smoking his cigar
and Miss Dolores took them up-stairs to see
her wedding finery; the dainty morning frocks,
the more elaborate gowns for evening wear,
and finally the white satin wedding gown which
Mr. Pinckney had insisted upon, though it was
to be but a simple ceremony performed at
home.</p>

<p>“Mercedes is bringing my wedding veil,”
Miss Dolores told the girls, “Spanish lace that
Cousin Teresa is sending. The dear child has
been longing so to come and I am so glad
they consented to it. We shall keep her for
a good long visit, I hope. She can speak
some English now and it will be an excellent
opportunity for her to improve herself in the
language.”</p>

<p>“Is she coming all alone?” asked Mary
Lee.</p>

<p>“No, she comes with some friends of the
family who sailed from Havre. Other friends
took her as far as Paris where the Dos Santos
met her. I hope the child has not been very
sick on the journey. The steamer was expected
this evening, but is a little late. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
there is not much doubt but that she will dock
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I am almost glad she didn’t come before,”
said Nan, “for we might not have reached
here in time, and it is stringing along the
excitements more gradually to have her come
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, me, but it is exciting,” said Mary Lee
giving Miss Dolores a squeeze. “We stopped
to see about the bridesmaid frocks before we
even went to the hotel and they are promised
faithfully by Wednesday evening, so we shall
surely have them for Thursday.”</p>

<p>“I had Mercedes send her measurements
and I think hers will not need to be altered.
Would you like to see it?” Wouldn’t they?
And the pretty girlish gown of white silk mull
was displayed. Mercedes was to be maid of
honor and the four Corners the bridesmaids.
Nan and Mary Lee were to wear soft buff; the
twins were to be dressed in delicate green.</p>

<p>“And you are going to have chrysanthemums,
of course, for decorations,” said Mary Lee.
“What flowers do we carry?”</p>

<p>“Roses to remind us of Italy, where we were
so happy when the roses were climbing everywhere.
I shall carry white ones, you and Nan
those deep saffron-colored ones shading to pink,
and the twins will have pink. Mercedes will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
have creamy colored ones,” Miss Dolores told
them.</p>

<p>“Lovely,” declared the girls.</p>

<p>“And Mr. St. Nick is quite satisfied to have
you married,” said Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure he is. Once he made up
his mind to accept the fact he has been goodness
itself, and I really think he would be disappointed
now if we were to put it off. He
told me a few days ago that if he were called
from this world he should feel very content
that he had left me in the keeping of a good
man, and that it was a great comfort to
him.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Kirk was announced and the girls
went down to greet him and then to entertain
Mr. St. Nick in the library, leaving the lovers
to themselves.</p>

<p>They were all up betimes the next morning
and were down on the dock to see the great
steamer come slowly up the harbor. Mercedes
caught sight of the little group, and then Mary
Lee distinguished her, and they began signaling
and waving handkerchiefs until down
the gangplank came the little Spanish girl
to throw herself into the arms of her friends,
half laughing, half crying in her excitement.</p>

<p>The affair of luggage did not detain them
long and soon they were whirling through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
the streets in the carriage, Mercedes exclaiming
first in broken English, then in Spanish.
“How is wondherful the large high build,”
she said. “Ah, mucha gente! mucha gente!
Is very many person, yes?”</p>

<p>“Did you have a good voyage?” Nan
asked her.</p>

<p>“Ah, but yes, I think good. I am at a time
a sickness not to go the table, but I am soon
recover. How I have the pleasure of see you.”
She laid a hand affectionately on an arm of
each girl friend. “When my mother say me,
Mercedes I permit the to go, I am make a
scream of joy. I spik Eenglis, yes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have learned much,” Mary Lee
told her.</p>

<p>“We have this year an Eenglis mees who
is tich us. My sisther and I have progress,
she say. I say my sisther when I am return I
spik more better as before and I tich her.”</p>

<p>“You will learn very fast here, for you will
hear only English, and it is the best way to be
among those who speak a language if one
would learn,” Nan told her.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, but is very diffikewlt ondtherstandth
what is say. I wish you spik me very
slow. When is rapide I cannot.”</p>

<p>“We will try to speak very slowly, for we
know how hard it is to understand a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
language unless it is spoken slowly,” said Nan.
“I hope you will like New York.”</p>

<p>“How large and fine is. Paris is also fine.
I like Paris much, as also I will like much New
York to see how gay. A marriage it will be
gay also. My cousin, I bring the lace for you
to wear.”</p>

<p>“And there is such a pretty frock waiting for
you,” Mary Lee told her. “Your mother is
well and all our friends?”</p>

<p>“All well. And those of you?”</p>

<p>“Are well. You will see them to-day. My
sisters are very eager to meet you, Mercedes.”</p>

<p>“I am pleasing meet them.”</p>

<p>“And how is the little asinello, Neddy?”
Mary Lee asked.</p>

<p>“Very fine, very good, very well. Oh, I
have much to say you, to inquire also.”</p>

<p>The saying and questioning was carried on
at a chattering rate from this time out. Mercedes
was no sooner established in the room
next that occupied by Nan and Mary Lee than
she must see her bridesmaid frock; next, her
cousin’s pretty wedding clothes. Mr. Pinckney
never did anything by halves and once he had
accepted the fact of his granddaughter’s marriage
there was nothing too much for him to do
for her, and he had himself carried her off on
various shopping expeditions when he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
order gowns, wraps, hats to his taste and without
listening to her protests. Moreover he had
taken the greatest interest in having a suite of
rooms decorated and refurnished for her, making
them truly beautiful with fine rugs, choice
pictures, artistic hangings and upholstery.</p>

<p>“We call it the bride’s bower,” Mary Lee
told Mercedes as they led her to the apartments.
“We think they are the very prettiest
rooms in the house.”</p>

<p>Mercedes had never seen such elegance,
though the charm of the old and picturesque
made her own home delightful. Still, there
only simple furnishings were in order and it
seemed to her young eyes a bare place in contrast
to all this luxury, but she said nothing
about this, being a proud young person who
voiced a judicious, rather than extravagant, admiration.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinckney would fain have whirled them
all off to a play or the opera that first evening,
but Miss Dolores reminded him that Mercedes
was probably tired and that the excitement of
arriving in a new country was in itself exhausting,
so he gave up graciously and contented
himself with ordering large boxes of candy for
each girl, with flowers at their places at dinner.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Corner family arrived
in time for luncheon the next day and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
there was a great bustle and much chatter with
five girls in the house. Wedding presents were
arriving every day, and to Mary Lee was given
the extreme privilege of opening them, announcing
the giver and making a proper list.
In this she had an occupation dear to her heart.</p>

<p>The wedding was to be a small affair, only a
few friends and relatives being invited. Mr.
Pinckney’s daughter and her husband would
arrive from California a few days beforehand.
One or two cousins, the next nearest relatives,
would also be there, and Mr. Kirk’s family, his
brother who was to be best man, and his
mother. Charlotte Loring and Jo Keyes were
also down on the list, but the whole number
did not exceed twenty-five.</p>

<p>Of course there was much speculation about
the best man and the various “in-laws” but
there was so much to occupy every minute of
the time remaining before the great day, that
there was little opportunity for any outside
matters. Jack and Jean did find a chance to
go to see little Christine Klein, a protégée of
theirs and the Pinckneys’. They found the
child in the same comfortable apartment where
she and her grandfather had been established
two or three years before. Her lameness was
now scarcely perceptible while good food and
comfort had changed the wan little invalid into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
a much sturdier child. She was going to school
and learning rapidly. Her German accent had
nearly disappeared and altogether there was a
great change in Christine.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful time for Mercedes, who
was not allowed to get homesick, and whose
struggles with English were constant. She
daily came to one of her friends with some
problem. “You say me, ‘sit up,’ you say me,
‘sit down’ and it is the same,” she said one
day to Mary Lee.</p>

<p>Mary Lee laughed. “They don’t mean the
same exactly, for when you sit down you don’t
always sit up, though when you sit up you
must be sitting down.”</p>

<p>Mercedes lifted her hands with an expressive
gesture. “How it is diffikewlt. I no ondtherstandth.”</p>

<p>“I will show you.” Mary Lee took a
hunched-up position on a chair, letting her
shoulders drop forward. “Now I am sitting
down but I am not sitting up. This is sitting
up.” She took an erect attitude.</p>

<p>“I see, I see,” cried Mercedes. “That is
goodth. What says the conductor when he
wish me hurry? I do not know the bordth. I
cannot find in the dictionario.”</p>

<p>“What do you think he says? What does
it sound like?” asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“I think he say ‘ullabore,’ but I cannot find
the bordth.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say bordth, Mercedes; it is
word.” This was one of the most difficult
things for her to pronounce. “The conductor
says, ‘All aboard,’ but he speaks very rapidly.”</p>

<p>“And what does he mean by this allabor?
I cannot ondtherstandth.”</p>

<p>“He means that every one must hurry to get
on the car. You have the word abordo.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now I know. I say you many questions.”</p>

<p>“You <i>ask</i> me many questions.”</p>

<p>“Ah, mio!” sighed Mercedes. “Never shall
I learn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are doing beautifully. You
can understand us much better than you could
at first and you learn some new words every
day.”</p>

<p>“When you no speak fast I can tell, but
many thing make a puzzling when I wish
speak.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“I like know what is fowl.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is different kinds of birds that are
eaten, like chickens and turkeys.”</p>

<p>“And poultry?”</p>

<p>“Let me see. I don’t know that there is any
difference, yet there must be. Oh, yes, we hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
of fowls of the air so I suppose any kind of bird
may be a fowl while poultry are the kinds we
raise to eat. Let us get the dictionaries and
see.” Each brought her dictionary and turned
over the pages. “Here we have it,” Mary Lee
announced, “a fowl is an <i>ave</i>, and poultry
means <i>aves caseras</i>, house fowls. I am glad
we hunted that up for now I know two more
Spanish words, myself.”</p>

<p>“What are you two doing?” asked Nan,
coming in upon them.</p>

<p>“Improving our minds,” replied Mary Lee.</p>

<p>“As if there were time for that; you’d better
be like the busy bee and improve the shining
hour. Mr. Pinckney is prancing about like a
lunatic because there is no one to go with him
to meet the Roberts. He has just had a telegram.
I have simply got to keep an engagement
with Charlotte to see about my room or I
may miss getting it. Miss Dolores is in the
hands of the dressmaker, and so it goes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d love to go with him,” Mary Lee
hastened to say. “Are you ready to start right
away, Nan? Just stop on your way out and
tell him I will be down in two seconds. Come
on, Mercedes. We can ride down with him and
if there isn’t room coming back we can take a
car or a hansom or something.”</p>

<p>So they rushed off and Nan proceeded on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
her errand. It was the first moment she had
had alone since her arrival in New York and it
was fortunate, she told herself, that it was so.
The past summer was like a dream, now that
the rush of the present was upon her. Jo and
Charlotte were both in town, the former already
hard at the tutoring which she had secured,
and the latter on hand for the wedding. She
was the niece of Mr. Pinckney’s son-in-law, and
therefore was considered a relative. Naturally
the wedding was the all-absorbing topic with
all the girls, though college came a close second.
Nan would be at the Pinckneys’ for a
couple of weeks, and take her time about settling
in her new quarters. She had decided
upon a room to herself and it was about this
she was now about to consult Charlotte. As
she turned up Morningside drive an automobile
whizzed past, but not before she caught a
glimpse of Marcus Wells and Miss Romaine.
It was all like a flash, and for a moment the old
feelings were strong within her. Here they
were in the same city. By a simple word she
could see him. She had only to send her card
and he would call. How strange it was that
she might not even do that after their days of
comradeship at camp. She had already written
from Maine a short note of thanks for his
mementoes, but she gave no address, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
note was of the most formally polite character.
She had shown it to her mother who had approved
of what she wrote. She might run across
him here in New York almost any time and
for a moment she regretted her choice of a college,
but it was only for a moment for she realized
that her life would be very full. Already
the dreams were bereft of their vividness.
With a little wistful smile she pursued her way
and was soon lost in the reality of her present
plans as she and her friends discussed college
and its many interests.</p>

<small>THE WEDDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> a houseful as there was at the Pinckneys’.
Mr. and Mrs. Roberts had arrived two
days before the affair; Nan, Mercedes and Mary
Lee were already on hand, a couple of cousins
from out of town were received later, and there
were others constantly coming and going.
Mary Lee was kept busy with the presents, Nan
volunteered to help with the packing, while
Mercedes made the acquaintance of Mrs. Roberts,
Charlotte and Jo. As for Mr. Pinckney,
he was everywhere, ordering, suggesting, rushing
to the telephone, sending off telegrams,
summoning the butler, carrying off his daughter
for a consultation, gathering the whole company
around him to get opinions on some sudden
decision.</p>

<p>Miss Dolores, rather pale and nervous, had
enough to do; though surrounded as she was
by her friends, she was spared much detail.
Mary Lee followed her about whenever there
was a lull in the wedding presents, and Mr.
Pinckney made sudden descents upon her with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
“Dear bless me, dear bless me, I don’t know
what I am going to do!”</p>

<p>“But, father,” said Mrs. Roberts, on one of
these occasions, “you are not going to do anything.
You are to stay here just as you have
always done. You don’t have to take a wedding
journey, and Harold isn’t going to shut
up Dolores in a dungeon and feed her on
bread and water, you know. There is no use
acting as if this were a visitation of the enemy
when Dolores is to be carried off willy-nilly.”</p>

<p>“I know, my dear, I know,” her father would
reply, “but I can’t get exactly used to it.”</p>

<p>“We’ve a lovely plan,” said Mary Lee, coming
into the library where these two were.
“Miss Dolores wants to have all the wedding
party to dinner to-night and use all the wedding
silver and such things as she can of that kind,
then we are to have a sort of rehearsal after
dinner and all get acquainted after that in some
jolly sort of way.”</p>

<p>“Charming, charming!” cried Mr. Pinckney
springing to his feet. “I must see Jennings
about that,” and he trotted off to give orders
to the butler about different things suggested
to him by this plan.</p>

<p>So bridesmaids, best man and near relatives
sat down to the table with the bride and groom
that evening to enjoy the new silver and comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
upon the handsome centerpieces, the fine
napery and the beautiful china. An elaborate
piece of embroidery, which Mercedes had done,
occupied a place of honor, and was so much
admired that the little girl was quite embarrassed
by the praise.</p>

<p>The best man, a nice, unaffected young Marylander,
was placed next to Mercedes, her office
as maid of honor demanding that. Mary Lee
sat the other side and next to Mr. Roberts.
Nan found her place was next to Mr. Kirk and
a boyish young cousin from out of town who
was greatly set up at finding himself in the
midst of so many pretty girls. He was to be
one of the ushers; the other three were to arrive
later in the evening. Mr. Kirk’s mother sat on
Mr. Pinckney’s right, Mrs. Corner on his left.</p>

<p>“I think it is the most delightful thing to eat
from the wedding presents,” said Jack to her
neighbor, Mrs. Roberts. “I just love it. Wasn’t
it dear of Miss Dolores to think of it? Mrs.
Bobs, I haven’t had a chance to talk to you
about Carter. Why couldn’t he come?”</p>

<p>“Because he very kindly offered to stay in
order to give us the chance of coming. We
couldn’t all leave very well.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he send me any message?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dozens of them, and he sent you something
he wants you to wear to the wedding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>“How lovely! When may I see it, Mrs.
Bobs? Right after dinner?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think I can easily get at it. I
have not had a chance to before, for there has
been so much going on and so much to talk
about.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what it was. I suppose you
wouldn’t mind telling me as it isn’t Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Do you really want to know before you see
it?”</p>

<p>“Why”—Jack was doubtful, “yes, you might
just tell me what it is without describing it at
all, then I’ll be half surprised. It will make the
dinner seem so long if I don’t know and I do
want to enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Roberts laughed. “You are the same
funny youngster, Jack, that you were three
years ago. Very well, then, it is a bracelet.”</p>

<p>“How deliciously lovely. I hope mother will
let me wear it. I have never had one. Isn’t
Carter a dear? Mrs. Bobs, when we are married
I hope we can live next-door neighbors to
you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Roberts laughed again. “I hope you
can, I am sure. So you still hold to your first
love, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he isn’t my first love, exactly. I
had ever so many before him, but he is the
most grown up so it is the most serious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>“I see.” Mrs. Roberts’ dinner companion
certainly did not fail of entertaining her.</p>

<p>“There are lots of things I want to ask you,”
Jack went on. “Have you still Wah Sing?
And do tell me about Clarence Opdyke. Carter
hasn’t written of him for ages.”</p>

<p>“We still have Wah Sing, and as for Clarence,
he is somewhere at school, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Then that is why Cart hasn’t mentioned
him, I suppose. I expect Carter seems as if he
really belonged to you all by this time.”</p>

<p>“He does indeed. We missed him greatly
the year he went abroad and were glad enough
to see him back again. I want to hear all
about your trip some time when we are quietly
by ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Is Carter quite well, now?”</p>

<p>“He is so much better that the doctors give
him the hope of an entire recovery, but I feel
pretty sure he will not, even then, desert California.”</p>

<p>“I think I am rather glad of that,” said Jack.
“Are you going to make a real long visit, Mrs.
Bobs?”</p>

<p>“I shall not be in New York more than a
couple of weeks, but we have promised your
mother to make a short stay in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good! You can have Nan’s room, for
she won’t be there, and we’ll have a jolly time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
showing you around. Maybe we can all go on
together, for Jean and Mary Lee and I are going
to stay till Miss Dolores comes back, so we
can help comfort Mr. St. Nick.”</p>

<p>“I am very sure he appreciates that, and it
will be a great thing to have you all while I am
here.”</p>

<p>“We think it is going to be great fun,” returned
Jack, and then she gave her attention to
the next course which happened to be something
she particularly liked.</p>

<p>After dinner the matter of the bracelet was
given attention and Jack was made the proud
possessor of the ornament, merely a simple
little gold band, very plain, and so the more
suitable for so young a girl. Jack lost no time
in displaying it. “I may keep it and wear
it, mayn’t I, mother?” she asked somewhat
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Why, I think so, dear. Carter is an old
friend and we couldn’t refuse to accept his little
gift.”</p>

<p>“And I may wear it to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, on such an occasion you are at
perfect liberty to wear it, but you must not put
it on at all times.”</p>

<p>“I will ask you when I ought to.”</p>

<p>Yet Jack was nothing if not heroic, and seeing
on Jean’s face a woebegone look she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
after a great struggle, “After all, Jean, I won’t
wear it to-morrow because we are to be dressed
exactly alike and it might spoil the effect if I
had a bracelet and you didn’t.”</p>

<p>Nan who was standing near laughed at the
idea of the small gold band having such an
effect, but she gave Jack a hug. “You old
precious,” she said. “I will lend Jean my
bracelet that Aunt Helen gave me on my birthday
rather than not have you wear yours.”
And so it was arranged to the satisfaction of
all three.</p>

<p>Next another pretty piece of jewelry came
into the possession of all the bridesmaids when
Miss Dolores collected them into her room to
give them her gift. Mercedes received a dainty
locket and chain, while to the four Corners
were given pearl pins, all of the same shape,
though each was set with a different jewel, besides
the pearls, to correspond with their birth
months, so Mary Lee’s were emeralds for May,
Jack’s and Jean’s turquoises for December,
while Nan’s was set with topazes, for November.</p>

<p>“What a pretty idea,” exclaimed Mary Lee,
highly delighted. “I am so delighted to have
my birthstone.”</p>

<p>“And there is another clever idea in having
the stones set in the four corners,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“To represent you four Corners,” Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
Dolores told her. “You are all jewels, you
know. Grandfather was so interested in having
them made according to a design that
Harold drew, so you see we are all three represented
in them.”</p>

<p>“I shall prize mine above anything I have,”
declared Mary Lee, “and I shall treasure it all
my life.”</p>

<p>“Now let’s go down and show them to everybody,”
said Jean, pinning her gift on.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t wear it till to-morrow,”
Jack chided her. “Must we, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“Well, but we can show them, can’t we?”
Jean asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose we can do that. Come, girls, if
you have prinked enough we’d better get over
that rehearsal.”</p>

<p>So they all rustled off down-stairs, Mary
Lee holding Miss Dolores tightly by the hand.
She had a sense of approaching loss, and perhaps
no one in the company could appreciate
Mr. Pinckney’s feelings better than Mary Lee.
She wanted her friend to marry Mr. Kirk, of
course, but would it ever be quite the same
again when her beloved had stepped into a
new world? Mary Lee sighed as they entered
the big drawing-room and Mr. Kirk came
forward to meet them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>“We’ve been discussing the music,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” exclaimed Miss Dolores.
“We have never given a thought to it. Here,
Nan, you are the one to help us decide.”</p>

<p>Nan’s thoughts flew to the little point opposite
Three Rocks. The words came back
to her, “When you are walking into this you
will say to yourself, ‘The last time I heard that
was when that renegade artist played it for
me.’” No, she would not think of him, and
she hoped they would not insist upon the
Lohengrin Bridal Chorus.</p>

<p>“Your grandfather and my mother have just
put in a petition for the old Mendelssohn wedding
march,” said Mr. Kirk. “They say it
was played when their weddings took place
and they wish we could have it, for one thing,
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Miss Dolores looked at her grandfather with
a gentle smile. “Of course we must have it,
then,” she said. “We might have it for the
entering, and have something else after the
ceremony,” she turned to Mrs. Kirk.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” said Mrs. Kirk.
“Every one wants the Lohengrin music nowadays;
they say the other is so hackneyed.”</p>

<p>“But I think it is less so than the other has
come to be, and I shall like to have what you
and grandfather remember so happily. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
need not have a march at all except for the
entrance, for you know it will not be as if we
were at church. There will be no marching
out. We shall stay where we are and I think
we can trust to Nan to make a good selection.
What do you think, Nan?”</p>

<p>Had they read her wishes they could not
have suited her better. “I quite agree with
you,” she replied. “If you like I’ll see the
musicians when they come to-morrow, or better
still, I’ll call them up first thing in the morning
and we can have something quite lovely and
appropriate, I am sure. Leave it to me, Miss
Dolores.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I shall be very glad to, for I know
you will not distress us with any of the so-called
popular music one sometimes hears at weddings.
Now, let us see just how we are to go
in and all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to be in the procession this
time,” said Nan. “Mrs. Bobs can take my
place while I play the wedding march for you.”
She sat down at the piano saying triumphantly
to herself, “So, Mr. Marcus Wells, I
have defeated you in this particular. No Lohengrin
shall spoil my pleasure to-morrow,” and
she started up the chords of the Mendelssohn
march as a signal for the little company to
enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>This duty over, there was a slight feeling of
uncertainty as to what should be done next.
The three ushers had arrived and had been
presented. Every one sat down and began to
talk rather stiffly, but this did not suit Jack’s
ideas of getting acquainted. “Do let’s be
jolly,” she cried looking around upon the rather
seriously disposed group. “Mrs. Bobs, won’t
you laugh, please? Mr. St. Nick, you look as
solemn as an owl. Mr. Kirk, won’t you say
something funny?”</p>

<p>“Jack!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You wanted me to say something funny,
and I don’t know anything funnier than you
are.” This brought the laugh Jack had demanded,
and she was satisfied even though it
was at her expense.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a dance,” proposed Nan. “I’ll
play for you all.”</p>

<p>This delighted Jack. “Everybody must
dance. We’ll have a reel, Nan, or ‘Pitch in
Tucker.’ Let’s have that first. Come on, Mr.
St. Nick, you’ve got to dance with me.”</p>

<p>“I? Heaven forbid that I should make a
spectacle of myself.”</p>

<p>“But that is silly, you know, to feel that way.
I have seen much stouter persons dance. Didn’t
you ever do ‘Pitch in Tucker’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>“Away back in the dark ages, perhaps; in
the days of my slender youth.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t forgotten?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I could manage it with
some one to set me right when I make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you will have to do it. I shall
be very much offended if you don’t and you
certainly ought to dance at your granddaughter’s
wedding; it wouldn’t be respectable not to.”
Jack put on her most pleading expression and,
as usual, won the day.</p>

<p>So in a few minutes the best man was bowing
before Mercedes, one of the ushers had
claimed Mary Lee, the young cousin had smiled
inquiringly at Jean and had met an assenting
smile, and so it went till every one was provided
with a partner except Tucker, who properly
could have none. Mr. Kirk and Miss
Dolores led off, and “Pitch in Tucker” gaily
rang out from under Nan’s touch. Tucker was
left in the person of an old family friend of
Mr. Pinckney’s age who showed such alertness
as soon allowed him to secure Jack as a
partner, leaving Mr. Pinckney looking wildly
around.</p>

<p>It was a merry dance and every one felt
better after it. Then the older persons begged
for a chance to rest, while the younger ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
asked for a two-step and then for a waltz. The
old friend, Dr. Winters, put Mr. Pinckney to
shame by dancing the round dances and doing
it well.</p>

<p>“Come on, Nick,” he cried, “it would
reduce your weight if you kept up this sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“I should think it would,” groaned Mr.
Pinckney, still puffing after his recent exertions
in Tucker. “I don’t want to drop in an
apoplectic fit on the very eve of the wedding.”
But he was induced to try the Virginia reel
which Nan informed them was the same as the
old dance of Sir Roger de Coverly, and this
ended the evening’s dancing. Then Jennings
brought in refreshments and they settled down
into a quiet talk, but there was less restraint
and every one felt that he or she knew every
one else much better because of the rollicking
dance.</p>

<p>The music was the first thing on Nan’s mind
in the morning and after some discussion over
the telephone she arranged it to her satisfaction.
Some of Grieg’s bridal music, one of
Chopin’s études, the prize song from the
Meistersinger, and some Spanish dances were
stipulated for, the rest being left to the discretion
of the musicians who promised no
popular airs and no Lohengrin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>As the wedding was to be at high noon the
house below was given over to the florists early
in the day while up-stairs the five little maids
were dressing the bride and themselves.
Charlotte and Jo arrived promptly and were
permitted to see Miss Dolores before she should
go down. She was very lovely in her trailing
satin gown, and her veil of Spanish lace,
arranged mantilla-wise, the orange-blossoms
confining it placed as a Spanish girl might
have worn them, for so maid of honor and
bridesmaids decided it should be. “It is not
so conventional,” said Nan, “and it is so becoming.”</p>

<p>Mary Lee could scarcely take her eyes from
this beautiful vision long enough to attend to
her own toilet, an unusual state of things for
Mary Lee. However, she did give attention
enough to herself to appear very dainty and
pretty in her soft buff frock by the time she
should be ready, and had full five minutes in
which to admire herself after she was dressed.
“Isn’t it a good thing,” she said to Nan,
“that we shall not have to wear our frocks on
the same occasion again? You will be in New
York and I in Washington. They are so
exactly alike, you see, and people might think
there were two sets of twins in the family if we
dressed in pairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>Nan laughed. The thought would never
have bothered her. “Well, I will try to wear
mine out at college festivities,” she promised,
“so as not to disgruntle you, Mary Lee. Are
the twinnies ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother and Aunt Helen saw to them.
I left Jean clutching your bracelet preparatory
to putting it on. Of course Jack has worn hers
since she got out of bed this morning.”</p>

<p>“Ready, girls?” inquired Mrs. Roberts
coming to the door. “It is time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it?” Mary Lee drew a quick breath,
then she flew off to Miss Dolores. “Please,
please,” she whispered tearfully, “kiss me the
last one before you become Mrs. Kirk.”</p>

<p>The girls gathered around her. She kissed
one after another, Mary Lee last, then they
descended the stairs in order, the twins going
first and feeling very important.</p>

<p>It was all over in what seemed an incredible
short space of time, and then every one began
to chatter, and there was much kissing all
around. The musicians struck up the Grieg
music and then the wedding breakfast was
served which was made as lively an affair as
possible by the united efforts of the guests,
each seeming to feel it his or her bounden duty
to keep up Mr. Pinckney’s spirits. Once or
twice he looked at Miss Dolores, wiped his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
eyes and turned quickly away, then some one
would start up a funny story and presently
down both sides the table every one would be
laughing.</p>

<p>After a while Mrs. Roberts looked at her
watch and whispered something to the bride
who arose and left them. Some one began a
song, but the girls realized that this was a most
important moment and they all rushed to the
foot of the stairs. At the top Miss Dolores
turned and smiled down upon them, then she
tossed her bouquet in the air and—Jack caught
it!</p>

<p>“Jack Corner, you little wretch!” Jo took
her by the shoulders and shook her. “Do you
mean to say you are going to be married
before any of us?”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” returned Jack calmly, “if
Carter wants me to and mother says I may.”</p>

<p>This raised such a laugh as made even Mr.
Pinckney forget his granddaughter and when,
in a few minutes, she came down ready for her
journey, he was as ready as the rest with confetti.</p>

<p>But after bride and groom were whirled
away, Mary Lee in tears sought the library
where she could get over her little weep alone.
She was softly crying in the depths of a big chair
when Mr. Pinckney appeared in the doorway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
wiping his eyes and looking the picture of
misery. At sight of Mary Lee he stopped
short, gave a little sigh, then a chuckle and
went off. He returned in a moment with Jack
who, beholding her sister behaving in what she
considered a disgraceful manner, marched up
to her and said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mary Lee, I’d be ashamed of myself
to be seen with a red nose on Miss Dolores’
wedding day and before such a nice-looking
young man as Mr. Howard Kirk. He has been
asking where you were.”</p>

<p>Mary Lee drew herself out of the depths of
the chair, caught the twinkle in Mr. Pinckney’s
eyes and rushed up-stairs to bathe her face,
powder her nose and presently appear in better
trim.</p>

<p>Charlotte, Jo and Nan were marching up
and down the hall, arms around one another’s
waist, softly singing a college song, Jean was
entertaining the boy cousin, the other three
ushers had departed at the time of the disappearance
of the bride and groom, and the best
man looked rather out in the cold. So to him
Mary Lee turned her attention. Jack, sitting
very close to Mr. Pinckney, was assuring him
of her everlasting devotion and telling him in
the most approving manner that he had behaved
beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>“You are a true comforter.” Mr. St. Nick
smiled down at the earnest little face. “It isn’t
the first time you have played that part, either.
Well, you children gave her to me, and you are
the ones who should rally around me now that
she is taken away.”</p>

<p>“But she isn’t really taken very far and she
will soon be back again with Mr. Kirk as a
grandson. Think of that, you will have a real
live grandson. Besides, you see, you have had
her much longer than you expected in the beginning,
for she was to have been married last
Christmas, only Mr. Kirk’s mother was so ill.
I am rather glad, myself, that they had to put
it off, for now we are having the good time and
it would have all been past and gone if they had
married when they first said. I can’t get over

after a moment.</p>

<p>“I am thinking about that, myself,” answered
Mr. Pinckney a little ruefully, “but I reckon I
can stand it.”</p>

<p>October was at hand. In a few days college
and school life would begin when, as Nan remarked
to her chums, the four Corners would
become a triangle in Washington, but she
hoped an acute angle might be found in New
York. Her thoughts were busy with the new
life stretching out before her. Jack and Jean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
were absorbed in the good time of the present
moment. Mary Lee looked across the room at
Mr. Pinckney and Mrs. Kirk who smiled back at
her. They were all three following in thought
the two who had that day faced the future together.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
